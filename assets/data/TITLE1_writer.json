With DA2 you can design, view and schedule reports. There is a semantic layer to define subject areas (domains), dimensions and measures. It is no SAP BusinessObjects, but I found it really powerful, flexible and feature rich. Strangely enough I do not really know anyone using DA2.</p><p>Like PowerInsight, it is a handy tool to pinpoint location of data in Cerner Millennium database - DA2 comes with ready to use domains and a set of dimensions and measures. You can simply drop them to a new document and generate actual database query.
