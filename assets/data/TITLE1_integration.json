Our clients include Charities such as Wikimedia and Farm Africa, art galleries such as the Photographers Gallery and Craft Central but also companies, trade associations and government bodies.</p><p>The role will comprise of 2 main elements. Most of our projects will involve a degree of data integration or migration and so we are looking to have a dedicated DBA to work on these elements of the projects. We want to develop an automated and scalable architecture that can be used in a flexible way across large client projects.</p><p>The other element of the role will be to be part of the infrastructure team in a devops/sysadmin capacity. You would also become a key architect in helping us to develop a robust SAS platform for a major SaaS product we are developing for Non Profit Organisations around the world.</p><p>The ideal candidate will have:</p><ul><li>Excellent SQL skills&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Experience of using ETL (Extract Transform and Load) tools such as Pentaho or equivalent&nbsp;</li><li>Confidence in a Linux &amp; PHP (LAMP/LEMP) Environment</li><li>Experience of other programming languages such as Python, PHP or Java (or a willingness to learn).</li><li>Previous experience with CI/DevOps tools platforms (i.e. Jenkins, Chef, Puppet, Ansible).</li><li>Is&nbsp;meticulous and loves documentation!</li><li>Is a&nbsp;real team player who likes to muck in and get the job done!</li></ul><p>What were looking for is someone who can grasp concepts quickly, has great attention to detail, and most importantly loves a tech challenge. In short, we’re a young team of self confessed geeks who love tinkering and tweaking until something is just right and are looking for someone who thinks and acts like us.</p><p>If you live and breath SQL and know your left joins from your inner joins&nbsp;then we would love to hear from you.</p><p><strong>Location</strong></p><p>At Compucorp we are a distributed team and we welcome people to join us from all around the world, however as a UK based Company some overlap with UK hours will be required. By default you should assume that your working hours would be +/- 3h max from GMT start times of 9.00AM&nbsp;UK start time. There is some flexibility in this but please be aware that staff members starting outside of these hours are rare and as such if you would expect these hours to be an issue for you then we would not suggest that you apply.&nbsp;</p><p>For the&nbsp;Data Engineer role, due to EU data protection requirements, the team member must be from either an EEA country or a country that the EU considers to have adequate level of data protection.
