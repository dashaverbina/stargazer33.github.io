Analysts using our geospatial visualization capability can instantly visualize and publish for data discovery and model testing on any desktop, mobile or tablet device.</p><p><strong>Who We Need</strong></p><p>Cultural Fit - While we hire all kinds of people and invent roles to fit them, there are three key traits we require of every team member that really define our team.</p><ol><li>&nbsp;Fun to Work With - Life is short and work should be fun. &nbsp;</li><li>&nbsp;Extremely Smart - We work on cutting edge hard problems and we need people who can both architect and code these systems at the same time while working with a highly intelligent peer group. &nbsp;</li><li>Passionate Engineers - We need people who really love programming and exhibit the energy and creativity that comes from being fully engaged in what you do.</li></ol><p><strong>Skills &amp; Requirements</strong></p><p><strong>Types of Roles</strong></p><p>We need talented people to help add cool new features to our platform. &nbsp;Below are the general categories of tasks we are working on, but often people straddle multiple areas so take them more as the general &quot;gist&quot; of what you might do with us. We are looking for smart, hard working, fun people and we will invent the right role to fit them. &nbsp;The key trait we are looking for is people who like to both architect/design and write the code for complex systems. &nbsp;</p><p><strong>(1) Client Side - </strong>Interactive Visuals: We maintain a JavaScript API for for interactive Data Visualization using our high performance web services. We need people both to help add new dynamic animated UI components and other features to the JS API. We also need people to build data driven visuals for our demo gallery if you are artistically or data analysis inclined. Enjoy working with Knockout, Angular, D3.js, HTML5? Check our our galleries to see the kind of stuff you will be working on <a href='http://maplarge.com/demos' rel='nofollow'>http://maplarge.com/demos</a></p><p><strong>(2) Full Stack Web Services -</strong> Full stack developers who are comfortable working on both client and server side to produce high performance applications powered by scalable web services are the backbone of our team. &nbsp;We run c# in both .net and mono server side and also maintain a flexible client side API with a large library of reusable components. We host and run large deployments that sometimes scale to thousands of computers for scientific/industrial/gov users and in a typical day process data over 15 billion records from 110 million streaming data sources. &nbsp;</p><p><strong>(3) Algorithm / Core Database Development - </strong>&nbsp;We built our own in memory database and distributed data analytics pipeline from the ground up with funding from DARPA, and we have a team of really talented researchers working on Pattern analysis, Streaming analytics, Spatial queries and Network graph functions that power our visual engines. We are always looking for practical people who love writing highly optimized code that straddles the line between research and software development. We don't usually publish scientific papers, but we are right out on the edge pulling algorithms out of the latest research papers finding really fast &quot;good enough&quot; approaches that let us tease interesting patterns out of data without getting lost in &quot;science experiment land&quot;</p><p><strong>Requirements:</strong></p><ul><li>US Person based anywhere in the US (100% remote allowed but no off shore)</li><li>5 Years work experience as a programmer</li><li>Highly Comfortable with C# and Visual Studio</li><li>Experienced with Web Development &amp; JavaScript</li></ul>                </div>                                    <div>                                    <div>                                        <div>        <a href='https://stackoverflow.com/jobs/apply/124860?reset=False&amp;ra=FScjxUoprcQ&amp;oqs=a%3DFScjxUoprcQ' rel='nofollow'>Apply now</a></div>                                                <div>                                                    <a rel='nofollow'>Ask a question</a>                                                                                                        </div>                                    </div>                        </div>        </div>            <h2>About MapLarge</h2>            <div><p>MapLarge provides Big Data Analytics and Visualization to make us safer, more productive, and more efficient. &nbsp;&nbsp;Our platform powers high traffic website visualizations, data discovery, and business intelligence applications.

We work all across the United States and Canada, just the way we have done since we started in 1991. Why would we work in an office when there are so many ways to collaborate and work together remotely?</p><p>Art+Logic is always seeking creative, bright, passionate programmers who are excited to take on new challenges. Currently, we’re looking for developers with&nbsp;mobile development&nbsp;experience, for possible, upcoming projects.</p><p>Our project teams usually consist of 1-5 developers plus UX/UI design and dedicated QA. Since we create custom software, our projects often involve different technologies and industries, so there is always something to new to learn. We like to keep things interesting!</p><p>This is a contracting position (1099), though we are looking for long term working relationships.

And then I remember: it’s the projects I work on. Nowhere else have I found such a variety of interesting and challenging assignments, and opportunities to grow as a developer. And it’s for a reason. People don’t approach Art+Logic to churn out routine apps; they come because they have something hard, often requiring research and skilled implementation.&nbsp;There is no better place than Art+Logic for software developers to do what they love — and also better hone their craft.</em>”</p><p><br>Job Type: 1099, rates ranging $35-$50/hour<br>Travel: None Required - Work from Home<br>Location: United States and Canada only</p><p><strong>Find out more at:</strong></p><ul><ul><li><a href='http://artandlogic.com/blog' rel='nofollow'>http://artandlogic.com/blog</a> (it's a<strong>&nbsp;tech blog</strong>, not a &quot;company&quot; blog)</li><li><a href='http://www.facebook.com/artandlogi' rel='nofollow'>www.facebook.com/artandlogic</a></li><li><a href='https://plus.google.coj/+ArtAndLogic' rel='nofollow'>https://plus.google.com/+ArtAndLogic</a></li><li><a href='http://www.artandlogic.com/careers' rel='nofollow'>http://www.artandlogic.com/careers/</a></li></ul></ul><p><strong>Have more questions?</strong>&nbsp;Email us at <a href='mailto:Recruiting@artandlogic.com' rel='nofollow'>Recruiting@artandlogic.com</a></p><p>Some things are best said multiple times. <strong>Please note&nbsp;your interest in this specific position, when applying.&nbsp;</strong>(You can do so&nbsp;in the &quot;Brag&quot; section.)</p>            </div>                            <h2>Benefits</h2>                    <ul>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Annual Conference</span>                            </li>                    </ul>                "

We enjoy building tools to help them and they seem to like what we do</li><li>We are not big on hierarchies and role division and although already agile, we are always advancing our approach to build better products and have happier teams</li><li>You really will have the opportunity to refine your role around your own strengths and interests; if you want to meet clients, design, code and deliver all aspects end-to-end, then we will have projects for you. Or, if you prefer to code with the door firmly shut, then we still have a place for you</li><li>We are based in a National Park - a great location if you value countryside, outdoor activities and avoiding life-wasting commutes. And you can also work remotely for at least some of the time</li><li>Don’t be fooled by the cuddly nature of our clients and their work. Typically they require (and we give) a lot for their money and that drives creativity, efficiency and sheer hard work. We see this as a positive</li></ul><p><strong>&nbsp;We are looking for?</strong></p><p>We need more developers (web mainly, but desktop or mobile experience is also useful).

But lawyers are terribly served by traditional recruitment agencies, who rely on anonymised web ads or inexperienced cold callers to engage potential legal recruits.<br /><br />Our founders, Tom Balmer and David Crocker, have been involved in the establishment and growth of some of the best names in the legal recruitment industry since the early noughties.  In 2017 they launched Third Way Legal, a marketplace platform designed to change the way lawyers engage with the jobs market.<br /><br />Third Way is a unique network, where lawyers can confidentially see which firms are looking for lawyers like them (in some ways it is similar to workinginstartups.com!). Following an amazing first year, where we have grown to 6 people and are annualising a million in turnover, we now are looking to build an in-house tech team.<br /><br />It's an extremely exciting time to join the business.  We are expanding into the interim market, looking to grow into new geographies, and have so many new feature ideas it hurts.  We're looking for a full-stack developer, comfortable with front and back end development, who is pragmatic and can eager to grow with the firm.  If that sounds like you, and you'd like to join us on our journey to change the legal recruitment industry, please get in touch!"

Du kan rätta fel och&nbsp;lägga till features&nbsp;genom att programmera i befintlig teknik, men också vara med och driva utvecklingen för&nbsp;den nya produkten.</p><p>Du gillar förmodligen precis som oss att utforska och använda nya teknologier i utvecklingsarbetet mot framtidens webbapplikationer. Du har själv - på fritiden eller i tidigare jobb - arbetat med hela produkten från design, arkitektur, back-end och front-end till deployment. Kanske har du en publik GitHub med något spännande projekt!?&nbsp;</p><p>Du&nbsp;har erfarenhet av ASP.NET web forms&nbsp;men också intresse av nyare teknologier. Vi gillar&nbsp;och tror att framtiden är att bygga snabba moduler i med frond-end i React.</p><p><strong>Vårt företag<br></strong>På e-Avrop utvecklar vi ett omfattande IT-stöd för upphandling, där svenska och utländska myndigheter, kommuner och företag får hjälp med hela upphandlingsprocessen.</p><p>Vår produkt har mängder av spännande funktionalitet såsom visuella processmodeller, rättighetsstyrd dokumenthantering, och realtidslösning för auktioner. Vi ser också många möjligheter för framtidens utveckling, med både business intelligence, machine learning och annat smart användande av vår samlade data. Allt för att kunna erbjuda nya och bättre tjänster inom området.</p><p>Vårt mål är att utveckla en enkel och kraftfull plattform med stor flexibilitet för upphandlare och företag. Vårt fokus ligger i att användarupplevelsen ska kännas modern, snabb och ha genomtänkt gränssnitt.&nbsp;</p><p>När vi träffas ses vi i trivsamma lokaler på&nbsp;Östermalm i Stockholm, ett stenkast från Tekniska Högskolan. Övrig tid jobbar vi effektivt hemifrån, med dagliga scrum-möten online.</p><p><strong>Arbetsuppgifter</strong><strong><br></strong>Den huvudsakliga arbetsuppgiften är underhåll av den befintliga web-applikationen för upphandlingsstöd samt viss nyutveckling i varierande teknologier. Vi jobbar i korta sprintar med prioriterad backlog.</p><p>Arbetet omfattar hela kedjan från rent underhållsarbete och bug-rättningar till feature requests med design av gränssnitt, datamodell,&nbsp;och teknisk lösning.</p><p>Vår utveckling sker främst i .Net-miljö (ASP.NET web forms) men mycket av våra nyare lösningar innefattar modernare gränssnitt skrivna i React, AngularJS och ren javascript. Vi använder självklart senaste verktygen såsom Visual Studio Resharper/Rider och Webstorm. Vi kör både macOS och Windows och hanterar kod med GitFlow. Vi har ett agilt tänk och har i nuläget en helt automatisk byggprocess och deployment.<br><br><strong>Din profil</strong><br>Vi tror att du är civilingenjör, datavetare eller motsvarande och har arbetat ett par år med systemutveckling. Du är van med att implementera webbservices och andra API:er såsom REST med flera och har goda kunskaper inom webbtekniker. Vidare tror vi att du har erfarenhet inom .NET, ASP web forms, C# och javascriptsbaserade front-end teknologier.&nbsp;</p><p>För att lyckas i rollen tror vi att du är analytiskt lagd, har ett strukturerat arbetssätt med en adaptiv syn på teknologi. Du kan arbeta självständigt och i grupp samt har lätt för att sätta dig in i, förstå och använda nya verktyg och koncept inom systemutveckling.

BAMTech isn’t just about streaming Baseball – we also manage NHL, Fox Sports Go, WWE, Eurosport, and several other content providers. You would be helping a team whose services act as the linchpin for video playback, handling new challenges of scale and speed in a rapidly growing industry. The company is aggressively expanding to meet increased demand, and you would be getting in on the ground floor of this new opportunity. You would help the team create new designs to meet our scaling demands, build out services in cloud infrastructure providers with exposure to AWS EC2, S3, Dynamo, and Kinesis, and help the team introduce new processes to scale. If you like tinkering with new technologies, have experience with high scale systems, or simply want to gain exposure to new tools, this team is a great fit. You’d be helping the team embrace microservices architecture with an emphasis on non-blocking, highly concurrent programming. Experience with Scala/Play/Akka is highly preferred, but not a requirement. With strong CS fundamentals and an entrepreneurial attitude, you’d be an asset to our team.</p><p>We are also seeking a Senior Engineer with C#/.NET experience to join our Stream Security team. This team is responsible protecting our content, with projects that span a wide variety of security concepts including studio grade DRM.
