The WalletHub brain enables users to make better financial decisions in a fraction of the time with three unique features:</p><ol><li><strong>Customized Credit-Improvement Tips:</strong>&nbsp;WalletHub identifies improvement opportunities and guides you through the necessary corrections.</li><li><strong>Personalized Money-Saving Advice:</strong>&nbsp;WalletHub’s savings brain constantly scours the market for load-lightening opportunities, bringing you only the best deals.</li><li><strong>Wallet Surveillance:</strong>&nbsp;Personal finance isn’t as scary with 24/7 credit monitoring providing backup, notifying you of important credit-report changes.</li></ol><p>In addition to the valuable intelligence the brain provides, WalletHub is the first and only service to offer free credit scores and full credit reports that are updated on a daily basis absent of user interaction, rather than weekly or monthly and only when a user logs in. Some other services hang their hats on free credit scores and reports, yet they’re still inferior to what WalletHub considers minor pieces to a much larger puzzle.</p><p><strong>Responsibilities include:</strong></p><ul><li>Testing and assuring high quality performance of website</li><li>Reporting and validating bugs for all components</li><li>Creating test plans and test cases</li><li>Identify opportunities for improvement and make constructive suggestions for change</li></ul><p><strong>Qualifications:</strong></p><ul><li>At least 2 years experience in Test Automation with Java and Selenium</li><li>Excellent attention to details</li><li>Ability &amp; motivation to work a minimum of 50 hrs per week</li><li>Proven ability to meet deadlines and handle multiple tasks in a fast paced environment</li><li>Must stay up-to-date with developing technologies and showcase them in your work</li><li>Proficient in written/spoken English</li></ul><p>Note: This position does not have a location requirement and be performed remotely (outside the US) and requires an overlap with US ET business hours from Monday to Friday to facilitate working together with US team members.</p>                </div>                                    <div>                                    <div>                                        <div>        <a href='https://stackoverflow.com/jobs/apply/156020?reset=False&amp;ra=Qk6up1ny6Xu&amp;oqs=a%3DQk6up1ny6Xu' rel='nofollow'>Apply now</a></div>                                                <div>                                                    <a rel='nofollow'>Ask a question</a>                                                                                                        </div>                                    </div>                        </div>        </div>            <h2>About Wallethub</h2>            <div><p>WalletHub helps all consumers reach top financial fitness by providing:<br><br>• Free credit scores and credit reports that are updated on a daily basis.<br><br>• Free 24/7 credit monitoring and personalized advice that will help you improve your credit and save money. <br><br>• More reviews on financial products, professionals and companies than any other website.<br><br>• An extensive education center coupled with the ability to ask financial experts your money-related questions for free .</p>            </div>                            <h2>Benefits</h2>                    <ul>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Stock options</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Health benefits</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Work visa sponsorship</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Competitive salary</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Work from home</span>                            </li>                    </ul>                "

They like things that seem mysterious. They deviate from the Happy Path. They like to experiment with apps.</li><li>You spot patterns. Similar bugs occur in unrelated software systems, so being able to sense patterns is very helpful.</li><li>You like games. There does seem to be a high degree of overlap between testers and gamers.
