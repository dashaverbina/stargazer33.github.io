Through a scientific method of determining which site improvements result in actual performance improvements, we replace the old way of designing sites through gut feel and management opinions with designing sites through data.</div><div><br></div><div>If you’re interested in checking out the swell people you’ll be working with, click here to&nbsp;<a href='https://crometrics.com/meet-the-team/' rel='nofollow'>learn more about the team.</a></div><div><h4>Our Hiring Process</h4></div><div>We’re glad you’re interested in working with us. We have a fairly unusual hiring process, but it has proven to work well both for us and for potential new hires. We have found that demonstrating basic competency is the best predictor of initial qualification for working with us, followed by actual work.</div><div><br></div><div>Our process reflects that: below, we outline our values and how we work, and then ask you to complete a small task. Assuming we like your response, we will hire you for a “paid interview” where you start working with us for a small number of hours each week. If both parties like working together, we expand the relationship. If not, we go our separate ways and both sides “won” in the deal!</div><div><br></div><div>This short essay sums up the philosophy we operate by:&nbsp;<a href='http://arches.io/2014/03/this-is-professionalism/' rel='nofollow'>This is Professionalism</a>. Please read it and if you’re willing to work this way, read on!</div><div><br></div><div><em>If you have questions as you go through this, make notes and if we haven’t answered them by the end, feel free to email&nbsp;<a href='mailto:matthew.gossage@crometrics.com' rel='nofollow'>matthew.gossage@crometrics.com</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href='mailto:chris@crometrics.com' rel='nofollow'>chris@crometrics.com.</a></em></div><div><br></div><div><span><em>*Our positions are fully remote and to ensure compliance with all applicable labor laws, are open to U.S.-based applicants only. In general, we are not hiring in Washington state, Oregon state, San Francisco, or New York.*</em></span></div><div><br></div><div><h4>Our Culture</h4></div><ul><li><span>We’re a remote company.</span>&nbsp;We are spread out all over the country and enjoy the flexibility remote working affords. Want to go on a mountain bike ride in the middle of the day? Cool, don’t forget your helmet! Need to pick the kids up from school? Nice, you’ve got parent of the year in the bag. We stay connected through Slack and&nbsp;<a href='https://crometrics.com/culture/workcations/' rel='nofollow'>workcations</a>, including one annual trip that is partially funded by the company.</li><li><span>We value elegant code as much as you do, but we move fast.</span>&nbsp;We’re writing code that runs&nbsp;<em>on top of</em>&nbsp;existing websites. Some tests only run for a few days before disappearing (though&nbsp;some do so well they become a permanent part of the client’s site). There will be polling patterns and liberal use of&nbsp;<code>!important</code>.</li><li><span><span>Again, we’re a remote company.</span>&nbsp;That makes communication — including writing and reading comprehension —&nbsp;<em>extremely</em>&nbsp;important. You’ll work closely with product managers, designers and writers. This is not a simple “pull tickets and check in code” gig. Successful applicants enjoy the process of defining and clarifying specs, documenting processes,&nbsp;<em>improving</em>&nbsp;processes, and uploading custom emoji to Slack.</span></li></ul>  </div>  <div>    <h4>Apply for this position</h4>    <p>Interested in working with us? You’re off to a good start.

Our fast-paced environment and can do attitude have already earned us several prestigious awards including last year's Gold Stevie for best financial services website from the American Business Awards and a gold medal as one of the products of the year from the Consumer World Awards.&nbsp; We're seeking hardworking, like-minded individuals to help us disrupt personal finance and make a tangible difference in people's everyday lives.</p><p>More specifically, we are harnessing the power of data analytics and artificial intelligence to build the brain of a smart financial advisor, whose services we’re offering to everyone for free. The WalletHub brain enables users to make better financial decisions in a fraction of the time with three unique features:</p><ol><li><strong>Customized Credit-Improvement Tips:</strong>&nbsp;WalletHub identifies improvement opportunities and guides you through the necessary corrections.</li><li><strong>Personalized Money-Saving Advice:</strong>&nbsp;WalletHub’s savings brain constantly scours the market for load-lightening opportunities, bringing you only the best deals.</li><li><strong>Wallet Surveillance:</strong>&nbsp;Personal finance isn’t as scary with 24/7 credit monitoring providing backup, notifying you of important credit-report changes.</li></ol><p>In addition to the valuable intelligence the brain provides, WalletHub is the first and only service to offer free credit scores and full credit reports that are updated on a daily basis absent of user interaction, rather than weekly or monthly and only when a user logs in.

You don't need to have experience in software QA (though you'll get up to speed faster if you do), but you'll need to stick with it if you've never done it before. If you haven't tested before, here are some key success factors:</div><div><br></div><ul><li>You read instructions and understand them. If the instructions say that something is out of scope and you test it, you’re wasting your own time.</li><li>You communicate precisely in English. Bug reporting is a particular form of communication that demands precision, concise wording, and logical ordering.</li><li>You are curious. The best testers aren’t robots who follow a script. They like things that seem mysterious. They deviate from the Happy Path. They like to experiment with apps.</li><li>You spot patterns. Similar bugs occur in unrelated software systems, so being able to sense patterns is very helpful.</li><li>You like games. There does seem to be a high degree of overlap between testers and gamers. Part of it is the thrill of the hunt, and the desire to understand the rules of a system and how to beat them.</li></ul><div><br></div><div>When you start as a tester at test IO, you'll get coaching from team leaders, then participate in test cycles with more experienced testers. You'll get the opportunity to see the kinds of issues they find and how they find them, so you'll be able to learn as you go along.</div>  </div>  <div>    <h4>Apply for this position</h4>    <p>You can get started here: <a href='https://hello.test.io/ios/' rel='nofollow'>https://hello.test.io/ios/</a></p>  </div>"
