Our stack: React, Python/Django, Postgres on AWS. We are looking for&nbsp;<strong><u>very strong app dev backend Python skills</u></strong>. Lots of ORM work. Lots of complex business logic. When we say &quot;app dev backend Python skills&quot; we mean you've written hundreds of thousands of lines of complex python code over years in a deployed application used by thousands of end users, not a few a dozen deployment scripts used by other engineers on your team. That said, your front end skills can suck. :)</p><p>We are based in Durango, CO, but you can work anywhere in the U.S. You can work from home, or we will set you up in a co-working space with your own office wherever you want. There's minor travel a couple of times a year here to Durango which is a pretty fun place to&nbsp;<em>have</em>&nbsp;to go to for work. We are perfectly set up for remote developers and most of our communication is via slack, email, and jira.</p><p>This is a standard software development job, so all the usual duties apply: write code, test code, review code, do tickets, occasional meetings for requirements (we keep it really light). The basic job is: write good code, get it live, rinse and repeat.</p><p>GitPrime is an amazing company. We are doing fascinating work to help engineers all over the world reach their potential as professional coders. We pay really well, have great benefits, give stock options so we all share in the upside, and we let you work from wherever you want.</p><p>Job Type: Full-time</p><p>Salary: $90,000.00 to $140,000.00 /year</p>                </div>                                    <div>                                    <div>                                        <div>        <a href='https://gitprime.breezy.hr/p/b1978aecc4f0-back-end-python-developer?source=stackoverflow' rel='nofollow'>                        Apply now        </a></div>                                    </div>                        </div>        </div>"

We believe time is valuable and you should be able to make the most of it. We focused on simplicity, security and scalability, to create an innovative service accessible to everyone.<br /><br />We’ve been rapidly growing over the last year and recently closed a $1.1m funding round (it’s £850k, but $1.1m sounds so much cooler doesn’t it) to fuel our global expansion. <br /><br />We’re a young team who strongly believes in making your work a positive part of your life, creating a flexible working environment and making an impact through what we do. People you know will be using our product and we take pride in offering them a good service. <br /><br />About the role:<br /><br />As a lead developer at Stasher you'll be involved in building systems that support new client-facing features as well as working to improve our internal tools and systems. Your day might range from working on our core API, to planning a new host dashboard and managing junior engineers based remotely.<br /><br />We're looking for someone with a strong overall development background to help act as the bridge between business and tech and to make architectural decisions. This means you'll have a lot of responsibility and autonomy. You should have experience with, and a love for, building scalable back end systems and beautiful front end ones. Ideally you'll have actually built a few in your time. A solid understanding of React or other MVC style frameworks and Python<br /><br />We're building part of our development team in Athens so we're open to London candidates who are happy to manage remote devs and occasionally visit, or to Athens based candidates who are happy to visit London regularly.<br /><br />Essential: <br />- Love for crafting beautiful, well-tested code. Our backend is primarily in Python (flask) and frontend is in React.<br />- Happy to work fast and can strike a good balance between quality and quantity of work <br />- 4+ years experience working within a wider team<br />- Have an opinion on development processes and infrastructure that's appropriate for a budding scale up. This is really your chance to take the helm at a fast growing and funded startup; we don't just want you to 'use the technologies you want' but to have an informed opinion on what prepares us for scale!<br /><br />Desirable: <br />- Experience with Django or Flask. <br />- Experience with Heroku<br />- Experience with React<br />- Experience at a scale-up<br />- Open-source contributions. <br />- Strong sense of good engineering and architecture. <br />- Good understanding of security."
