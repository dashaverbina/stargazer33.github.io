As a Business Sales Specialist, you’ll be the first point of contact for businesses that are considering 1Password. You’ll get the opportunity to help them learn more about the product, understand the best ways their team can use it, and get them started with a trial.<br /><br />What you’ll do<br /><br />- Help new business get started with 1Password, and keep the relationship with them strong.<br />- Proactively report on what potential clients need, and valuable feedback from existing ones, so the product team can improve the product and prioritize the right projects.<br />- Get to know potential customers over discovery calls and demos, and develop a relationship with them.<br />- Close several new deals per month, and generate new leads through outreach.<br />- Try new things: if something isn’t working, try a different tactic, reach out to the product team with questions, and help us reach different types of clients we haven’t encountered before.<br /><br />What you have<br /><br />- Passion for helping people succeed and feel more confident in their work.<br />- Experience with how businesses use software to be more productive and efficient.<br />- Adaptive explanatory skills that get people to understand, not just hear, what you're saying.<br />- A knack for learning things on your own and quickly adapting to new environments. Since 1Password is remote, it’s important to be independent in your research, but also have the humility to ask for help when you aren't sure about something.<br />- Excitement to speak with new people every day and do product demos and presentations with them.<br />- An understanding that conversation is about listening.<br /><br />What you also might have<br /><br />- Experience selling a product to someone – your siblings are lovely, but they don’t count.<br />- A track record with the acronyms SCIM, AD, CLI, SSO, and of course SAAS.<br />- Polyglottism! You could go to France or Germany for a week and jump right in to conversation, or do that from your computer, with a French riviera as your wallpaper.<br />- Personal experience with 1Password.<br /><br />Sounding like a hat you’d wear? Tell us what kind of hat that is."

I'll explain<br /><br />1 - We have a LIFE. That's right.. We let our WORK 'furnish' our lives. We have relationships, time to ourselves and we also work SMART to a point where we don't burn out.<br /><br />2 - We are all TRUSTED. We work alone and meet once a week. We work remote and get RESULTS. We are adults <br /><br />3 - We all have unique talents and have worked to our strengths. So we have our own 'domain' and love it<br /><br />4 - We have an awesome brand and growing fast - We don't need to rush too much to get great results.<br /><br />5 - We all have our 'A-Money' ( That's the money that pays all the bills so we can enjoy the journey togehter with BoxSmart.<br /><br />[ So? What is it you need Mister Boxsmart?? ]<br /><br />Aghhh... Good point!<br /><br />We are looking for a very KIND, sociable, intelligent, seasoned and DRIVEN sales person. <br /><br />Not someone that looking to just 'pay the bills'. Someone that acutally wants to be part of a FAMILY. Someone that can blatantly see how awesome BoxSmart is.<br /><br />someone that we can, literally, throw you leads (they come in daily) and service, nurture and grow a client.<br /><br />Commissions? Negotiatble. Not naff. A decent 20% chunk for the sales dept<br />Salaries? Probation we pay when you sell a fixed number of clients. We are true to our word. After that? we negotiate whatever you wish.<br /><br />BoxSmart is expanding too... To PouchSmart and also Meetup events!<br /><br />So if you want something that you feel part of. Something where we need your help on (Other than sales) and you want your BRAIN to be stimulated? Then drop us a line!<br /><br />We need a MINIMUM of three days a week from you. Starting around 10:30am remotely till around 5pm<br /><br />If this interests you (and you can see the benefits of BoxSmart) then get in touch!!<br /><br /><br />Team BoxSmart<br />"
