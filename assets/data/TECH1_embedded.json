This listing is for an Integrations and Backend Services Engineer.</div><div><br></div><div>MAVN provides high quality and affordable online ordering services for restaurants all over America. Our clients depend on our field devices, backend services, and point-of-sale integrations for serious fractions of overall revenue. Customers using our product depend on it working all the time, every time, so that their tacos come up as close as possible to the promised time.</div><div><br></div><div>MAVN is building out more systems than ever to support our growing client list and the integrations their customers clamor for. The good ship MAVN needs a few additional hands in the engine room to work on our Postgres database, APIs, background services and new integrations with point-of-sale systems, loyalty companies, gift card companies, payment companies, and more! The number of orders we deliver to restaurants is growing at an awesome monthly rate, and we need folks who can help us scale this monster.</div><div><br></div><div>In your first few quarters with MAVN, you'll build a few integrations between our systems and third-party systems, in the process learning our data model, and loading our infrastructure, deploy, tooling, and software philosophy into your head. As we grow comfortable with each other's work, we may task you with carving parts of our legacy monolith into services, or shanghaied into the frontend rewrite. As you integrate as a full member of the team, you will help us set standards, design systems, think rigorously, and do the right thing for our clients, their customers, and the whole company.</div><div><br></div><div>We're big fans of RDBMSen, and leverage our database's type system wherever we can. We're pragmatic testers, with a custom DB-layer testing system that you'll probably get a kick out of.</div><div><br></div><div>Since we're growing quickly, you'll have a lot of autonomy in how you perform your work. Our short term roadmap is focused on launching a complete rewrite of the customer-facing software, but once the bulk of that is off of the Engineering team's plate, there will be a bunch of awesome new projects that we'll need your hands on.</div><div><br></div><div>MAVN is a Texas company with remote employees in far-flung parts of the United States.

We’re looking for a senior full-stack developer with a willingness to acquire deep expertise around Ruby, Python, and React.js, in order to help us expand to support additional new high-tech sectors.</span></p><p><span>Analytics Fire is a small, distributed team working on a range of interesting projects. For example, last year we worked on a scalable IoT platform for utility grade solar power plants, a sales and design tool for residential solar, and a machine-learning powered autonomous cleaning robot. We’re looking for a fun, reliable, and highly collaborative, senior dev to join our team.</span></p><p><span>For reference, here is a list of technologies and tools we are currently actively using on a day-to-day basis:</span></p><ul><li><span>Front-end: JavaScript / React / Angular</span></li><li><span>Back-end: Ruby / Python / Node.js</span></li><li><span>Embedded (IoT): C, Embedded Linux, MQTT</span></li><li><span>Embedded (robotics): C/C++, ROS</span></li><li><span>Modern software techniques: RESTful APIs, SOA, PaaS, etc</span></li><li><span>Agile collaboration and DevOps tools: Github, Trello, Slack, Chef, Ansible, Docker, Vagrant, etc</span></li><li><span>Occasionally we need to do a small amount of work around: SFDC, iOS, Android, ARKit</span></li></ul><p><span>This is a remote position. We’re flexible about location and hours, so long as your working hours are in a very heavily US-overlapping time zone (eg: North America, Central America, South America, etc). We’re a really great match for a senior dev in a US-overlapping timezone who wants to work hard on interesting projects, while also having flexibility around time and geography.</span></p><p><strong><strong>Skills &amp; Requirements</strong></strong></p><p><span>Ideally, you should have 5+ years commercial full stack development, ideally within a startup environment. You should be comfortable autonomously driving your own high quality / high velocity contributions using a range of technologies.</span></p><p><span>We work with a variety of technologies, but are currently specifically looking for someone that has or can obtain expert level skills around Python, Ruby, and React.js.</span></p>                </div>                                    <div>                                    <div>                                        <div>        <a href='https://stackoverflow.com/jobs/apply/136187?reset=False&amp;ra=JFIBXryxPKo&amp;oqs=a%3DJFIBXryxPKo' rel='nofollow'>Apply now</a></div>                                                <div>                                                    <a rel='nofollow'>Ask a question</a>                                                                                                        </div>                                    </div>                        </div>        </div>            <h2>About Analytics Fire</h2>            <div><p><span>Analytics Fire was founded by a couple of data-nerds -- one a PHd in machine learning and the other a former VP of Engineering for an analytics platform -- who both are also serial entrepreneurs backed by prominent angels and VCs including Y Combinator and 500 Startups.</span></p><p><span>“Our goal founding, Analytics Fire, was to create the engineering department that we always dreamed of working for.
