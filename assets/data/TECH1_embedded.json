We’re looking for a senior full-stack developer with a willingness to acquire deep expertise around Ruby, Python, and React.js, in order to help us expand to support additional new high-tech sectors.</span></p><p><span>Analytics Fire is a small, distributed team working on a range of interesting projects. For example, last year we worked on a scalable IoT platform for utility grade solar power plants, a sales and design tool for residential solar, and a machine-learning powered autonomous cleaning robot. We’re looking for a fun, reliable, and highly collaborative, senior dev to join our team.</span></p><p><span>For reference, here is a list of technologies and tools we are currently actively using on a day-to-day basis:</span></p><ul><li><span>Front-end: JavaScript / React / Angular</span></li><li><span>Back-end: Ruby / Python / Node.js</span></li><li><span>Embedded (IoT): C, Embedded Linux, MQTT</span></li><li><span>Embedded (robotics): C/C++, ROS</span></li><li><span>Modern software techniques: RESTful APIs, SOA, PaaS, etc</span></li><li><span>Agile collaboration and DevOps tools: Github, Trello, Slack, Chef, Ansible, Docker, Vagrant, etc</span></li><li><span>Occasionally we need to do a small amount of work around: SFDC, iOS, Android, ARKit</span></li></ul><p><span>This is a remote position. We’re flexible about location and hours, so long as your working hours are in a very heavily US-overlapping time zone (eg: North America, Central America, South America, etc). We’re a really great match for a senior dev in a US-overlapping timezone who wants to work hard on interesting projects, while also having flexibility around time and geography.</span></p><p><strong><strong>Skills &amp; Requirements</strong></strong></p><p><span>Ideally, you should have 5+ years commercial full stack development, ideally within a startup environment. You should be comfortable autonomously driving your own high quality / high velocity contributions using a range of technologies.</span></p><p><span>We work with a variety of technologies, but are currently specifically looking for someone that has or can obtain expert level skills around Python, Ruby, and React.js.</span></p>                </div>                                    <div>                                    <div>                                        <div>        <a href='https://stackoverflow.com/jobs/apply/136187?reset=False&amp;ra=JFIBXryxPKo&amp;oqs=a%3DJFIBXryxPKo' rel='nofollow'>Apply now</a></div>                                                <div>                                                    <a rel='nofollow'>Ask a question</a>                                                                                                        </div>                                    </div>                        </div>        </div>            <h2>About Analytics Fire</h2>            <div><p><span>Analytics Fire was founded by a couple of data-nerds -- one a PHd in machine learning and the other a former VP of Engineering for an analytics platform -- who both are also serial entrepreneurs backed by prominent angels and VCs including Y Combinator and 500 Startups.</span></p><p><span>“Our goal founding, Analytics Fire, was to create the engineering department that we always dreamed of working for.
