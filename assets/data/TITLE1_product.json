Rather than working for a mega-corp, you will be working in a company where your work has real impact in the fun, high-growth stages of our evolution.</p><p>We are looking for security analysts to join our forensics team. You will assist our customers to investigate how their site was hacked and to repair their site and remove all traces of the intrusion. In addition to this you will also collect evidence from intrusions that will help improve our threat detection. You will need to determine how the intrusion occurred and then collect all IOC’s (indicators of compromise) and share this data with our product team in a structured way.</p><p>General requirements:</p><p>● You must be highly technical and be comfortable with a wide range of open source tools.</p><p>● Excellent written and verbal communication skills.</p><p>● You must work well in a team.</p><p>● You must be nimble, be able to come up with creative solutions to challenging problems and must have a mature approach to problem solving.</p><p>● Attention to detail.</p><p>Note: Applicants who can work weekends will be given priority consideration.</p><p>We have the highest star rating for any WordPress plugin in history and we pride ourselves on providing an excellent product with great customer service that helps secure small and large production websites. If you're passionate about information security and would like to help secure the web, this is your dream job. We take our team's family time seriously and don't ask you to work long hours if we can avoid it (we almost always can). Our entire team works remotely using Slack for casual interaction ­so you can live practically anywhere in the world as long as you have an internet connection. Wordfence is high growth, but we are not a startup. The company is still controlled by the founders, we are profitable and have been for many years. So you will enjoy the rush of high growth but you won't have to risk working for a company that is controlled by venture capitalists or may not be here tomorrow.</p>                                                                                                                                        <a href='https://defiant.workable.com/j/806EFFE4AE' rel='nofollow'>                        Apply now        </a>                                                                                About Defiant Inc            <p>At Defiant, ‘trust’ is the attribute we value most highly among our team members. We need to know that you can grab a task from a support ticketing system, communicate clearly with our customers and see the task to completion with excellent attention to detail. We don’t micro­manage and we trust that you will be able to see tasks through to completion and communicate with your fellow team members when needed or ask for help when needed. You will be working for a company that has code protecting over 2 million production websites.

    "content": "SOLVING THE PROBLEM OF FOOD WASTE <br /><br />OLIO is the world’s only neighbour-to-neighbour food sharing app, and our mission is to solve the problem of food waste in the home & local community. We do this by connecting anyone with spare food – which can be households or local businesses – with neighbours living nearby who would like it. Globally, over one third of all the food we produce gets thrown away, which is worth over $1 trillion. What few people realise however is that in the developed world, over half of all food waste takes place in the home, with the average UK family throwing away £800 of food each year - collectively adding up to £15bn. OLIO solves this with our award-winning mobile & web apps.  <br /><br />Over the past 2 years OLIO has grown from a local initiative in North London to a global movement. We now have over 465,000 users who have together shared well over half a million portions of food – with food being successfully shared in 32 countries and counting. Underpinning this incredible growth has been our volunteer programme, with over 19,000 people reaching out to spread the word about OLIO in their local community and rescue unsold food.

If you are not considering internships that are without salary or stipend, etc., this is not for you. Also, we work remotely (we all work from where we live). </p><p>&quot;Hashtags! Yay!&quot;</p><p>NO!!! </p><p>That's not actually what we're about. We build a suite of SaaS products for people and companies that expect social ROI: they need to get something back when they share to social.</p><p>RiteForge and RiteBoost do total social media optimization: images, custom visuals, link ads - and data-driven auto-hashtagging as well. For those who need to get business, sign-ups, or sales from what they share in Facebook, Twitter and beyond, RiteForge automates image creation and extraction, adds a call-to-action header to pages shared socially, and uses text analysis and machine learning to aid with hashtags as well.  </p><p>What is RiteKit?<br>The initial concept for RiteTag, our first product, was borne of the aftermath of the 2011 Earthquake and Tsunami in Japan. After witnessing the flurry of disorganized social media activity, our CEO and Founder wanted to help people get their social content discovered in an increasing noisy world.<br>What SEO does for web pages, SMO (social media optimization) does for video uploads, sound files, Facebook updates, Tweets... and it is much more than hashtags that does this. Today we continue to build tools to further our original mission to increase the customer's social media presence.</p><p>We build data-driven social media engagement SaaS products. Please spend one minute to get a quick understanding of all four of our tools: <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oYKPrk2U4Jo' rel='nofollow'>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oYKPrk2U4Jo</a> </p><p>What mktg/bizdev Interns (and staff) do:<br>• Learn far more than they teach in any university degree to prepare for a successful career in PR, Business Development or as an entrepreneur. (Best case scenario: after this internship you either launch your own startup, join one as a co-founder, or become so important to us that you create a position for yourself on our team.)<br>• Forge alliances with people at companies and startups that should be using our APIs and/or SaaS products<br>• Engage our growing community in Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Medium and beyond.<br>• Write case study articles for our blogs.<br>• Do what it takes to get original articles on getting things done with RiteKit in major news sites and top-tier blogs.<br>• Learn how to win at marketing</p><p>Terms &amp; Requirements:<br>• Ability to learn and teach RiteKit products and coach a business owner to use them so that they get social ROI. This will be your entry exam and how you will qualify for the internship.<br>• Ability to collaborate in a fast paced distributed startup team<br>• Commitment: 6 months at 3-5 hours/week OR 12 months at 2~3 hours/week (decide later, no rush)<br>• Be okay with the internship being UNPAID. <br>• Must be well-written and have proven ability to create visual content<br>• No relocation needed; we work remotely</p><p>Do ask what our former interns went on to do immediately following their RiteKit internship when you have your first interview (and how to independently research this).<br> <br>First, see <a href='https://medium.com/hashtag-academy/tagged/ritekitinterns' rel='nofollow'>https://medium.com/hashtag-academy/tagged/ritekitinterns</a> and especially the video in <a href='https://medium.com/hashtag-academy/ritekit-interns-tell-their-stories-acc09f4e1845' rel='nofollow'>https://medium.com/hashtag-academy/ritekit-interns-tell-their-stories-acc09f4e1845</a> to hear from our former interns, who share what they got from the experience, in learning, career-boosts, jobs and other opportunities, both with RiteKit and other employers. </p><p>As a self funded startup, we have been extremely lucky to have a passionate team, advisors and friends that have brought us this far. Unfortunately this also means we can only offer unpaid internships at the time.</p></div>"

If you’re in Asia you will need to work sometimes early in the morning from 6am for example. <br /><br />These are the types of things you would be doing:<br /><br />1. Managing a team of 3 developers in the Philippines who are the technical growth team.<br />2. Coming up with ideas for new onboarding experiments.<br />3. Meeting with our current conversion optimization consultant and working with them for any technical issues or helping them to come up with ideas.<br />4. Meeting with internal team members to help you come up with growth experiment ideas.<br />5. Looking at our data to find issues with our onboarding or sign up flow and generating improvements or experiments as a result of this review. <br />6. Meeting with another consultant who is responsible for our emails and generating split tests for our emails.<br />7. Writing copy for pages that you are working on.<br />8. Project management of issues such as getting listed on the G Suite marketplace and getting 50 reviews on the marketplace. <br /><br />Activities you'd potentially get involved with:<br />But it's not necessary to do this if these areas are not a fit to you.<br /><br />1. Meeting with Facebook ad consultant weekly to see  how they are going and get updates and push it forward<br />2. Meeting with Google adwords consultant every couple of weeks<br />3. In both cases for google adwords and Facebook you wouldn’t be actually doing the Facebook or Adwords<br /><br />Requirements:<br />1. You must have previously run growth experiments for a B2B software product most likely, although any good experience in conversion optimization is useful.<br />2. Experience and skills in data analysis.<br />3. Deep understanding of Google Analytics.<br />4. You do not need to be deeply technical <br /><br /><br />To apply, please go to this link- https://time-doctor.breezy.hr/p/d14c4ecde26e  and complete the requirements for the job.<br /><br />Only those who submit the complete answers will be considered for this job."

    "content": "*About Us*<br /><br />Do you want to build an exciting new brand in an industry ripe for a makeover?<br /><br />Join us on our mission.<br /><br />At Laka, we believe that traditional insurance fails to offer peace of mind. It’s an inconvenience people have to deal with – unpleasant, expensive and unfair.<br /><br />Laka has a new way to protect your favourite things in the world.<br /><br />What makes us truly different is that members of our community don’t pay a fixed premium every year, but only share the true cost of claims incurred by the community. Simple, but truly disruptive (Sorry for the D-word).<br /><br />The first thing we have chosen to insure are high-end bicycles. For that, we have assembled a community of real cyclists who protect each other's bikes against whatever happens.<br /><br />Every month Laka helps community members in need - when their gear is damaged or stolen. At the end of the month all costs are split between the community, but each member’s premium is capped at market rate. Instead of paying hefty margins, our customers know they will always get the best price for great cover.<br /><br />Insurance that just works.<br /><br />We went from concept to regulated business with a live product in 12 months. On the way, we joined fantastic ecosystems such as Anthemis’ Fellowship program and Startupbootcamp InsurTech, gathering a stellar host of business angels around us.<br /><br />You can be an integral part of the brilliant team taking the business from hundreds to thousands of customers. With our revolutionary approach to insurance, we have the opportunity to relentlessly challenge the status quo in insurance and build a brand which truly reflects our mission.<br /><br />We’re currently a team of 7, so everyone is vitally important to our success. You’ll be working directly with the company founders and will get to experience life in a startup company as we scale! We encourage you to get involved with any aspect of the business you are interested in. T-shaped people are the best!<br /><br />Our office is in Oxford Circus, but we are flexible and understand sometimes you just need to work from home or wherever inspires you the most.<br /><br />The specifics (including the final title) of the role will vary depending on your experience, but in any case, it will grow with you. We want bright people to join us on our journey.<br /><br /><br />*About You*<br /><br />You need to be prepared to hit the ground running, have an interest in learning new things, and be comfortable working in a (constantly!) changing environment. We are looking for someone who can relentlessly execute without losing sight of what really moves the needle.<br /><br />You love to craft engaging copy, create content and own the creative side of marketing. Help us shape the voice of Laka and communicate with customers effectively to create a kick-ass brand.<br /><br />When not flexing your creative muscle, you thrive on engaging with people (preferably cyclists). Running pop-ups, preparing trade fairs & races, collaborating with athletes and cycling teams will be just as important as the work behind your desk.<br /><br />Both are vital to building a strong consumer brand and a tight-knit community of cyclists.<br /><br />You know your channels and understand what tools to use, from organic to social and affiliate/referral driven acquisition. You are responsible for the top of the funnel and will work closely with the product team to build the best damn funnel in the world.<br /><br />In addition to you, we already have a design and marketing executive on board who will support you in all things design and social, and we are in the process of hiring a Partnerships Manager who will support acquisition through new partnerships.<br /><br />Ideally, you also have experience in consumer brands and feel comfortable in the cycling world. If you are a cyclist yourself, even better!<br /><br />You don’t need an insurance background to join us. We didn’t have one either.<br /><br />You must have the right to work in the UK.<br /><br /><br />*Bonus points*<br /><br />You know your way around Google Analytics, Sendgrid, Intercom, Keywords Planner, Facebook and Google Ads<br /><br />You have built offline and online communities before.<br /><br />You have built brands from scratch and understand what it takes.<br /><br />A passion for cycling and an open mind for future products<br /><br /><br />*Our Offer*<br /><br />£35-50k annual salary (depending on experience)<br /><br />Stock options: level depending on experience and expertise<br /><br />Flexible holiday policy<br /><br />Great working environment: Shared office near Oxford Circus<br /><br />Flexible work arrangements: as long as the work gets done<br /><br />Generous conference/training budget<br /><br />Child-care voucher<br /><br />Cycle-to-work scheme<br /><br />Regular team off-sites to collectively decide our future<br /><br />Weekly team lunch<br /><br />Above all: the opportunity to make a real impact to an archaic industry.<br /><br /><br />*The Process*<br /><br />We aim to reply to all applicants within a week of receiving your application. Our interview process will have several stages, each allowing us to get to know you better, both professionally and technically - and for you to understand our culture and ethos.<br /><br />The stages include:<br /><br />Personal or Skype interview<br /><br />Meet the founders and join us for a team lunch<br /><br />A real-world test project<br /><br />We hope to get all the above done within 2-3 weeks, depending on your availability and convenience."
