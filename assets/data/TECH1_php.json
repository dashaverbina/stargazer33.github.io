More specifically, we are harnessing the power of data analytics and artificial intelligence to build the brain of a smart financial advisor, whose services we’re offering to everyone for free. The WalletHub brain enables users to make better financial decisions in a fraction of the time with three unique features:</p><p>1) Customized Credit-Improvement Tips: WalletHub identifies improvement opportunities and guides you through the necessary corrections.</p><p>2) Personalized Money-Saving Advice: WalletHub’s savings brain constantly scours the market for load-lightening opportunities, bringing you only the best deals.</p><p>3) Wallet Surveillance: Personal finance isn’t as scary with 24/7 credit monitoring providing backup, notifying you of important credit-report changes.</p><p>In addition to the valuable intelligence the brain provides, WalletHub is the first and only service to offer free credit scores and full credit reports that are updated on a daily basis absent of user interaction, rather than weekly or monthly and only when a user logs in. Some other services hang their hats on free credit scores and reports, yet they’re still inferior to what WalletHub considers minor pieces to a much larger puzzle.</p><p><strong>How to Apply</strong><br><br>To get our attention, all you need to do is send us a resume. If we believe that you will be a good match, we'll contact you to arrange the next steps.

You'll write code that helps power mission-critical tools for millions of online stores.</div><div><br></div><div><b>The Role</b></div><div><br></div><div>You’ll focus on building new features and maintaining existing code, while also helping with code reviews and customer support. With over 60 different plugins, there’s a wide variety of work. You might spend time on some complicated frontend interactions using JS, then switch focus to working with a tricky external REST API for a while, and later work on adding unit/acceptance tests to our framework code.</div><div><br></div><div>You’ll have the opportunity to really dive into a problem and understand it before crafting a well-engineered, high quality solution. We believe the best work happens when given lots of uninterrupted time to think and code.</div><div><br></div><div>Our plugins are built on top of WordPress and designed to work with WooCommerce, so we use PHP 5.3+ (moving soon to PHP 5.6 minimum) and we write all new JS in CoffeeScript. We follow a superset of the WordPress coding standards and actively invest in tooling &amp; testing to improve both the quality of our products and the happiness of our team building them.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>We work primarily through GitHub and Slack, so you should be able clearly express your ideas via comments and messages.

<div><p><strong>The No-Bullshit-iest Way We Can Describe This Job In The Least Amount Of Words In A Run-On Sentence: </strong></p><p>We build a lot of different kinds of stuff for a lot of different kinds of folks (<a href='https://sanbornagency.com/work/' rel='nofollow'>https://sanbornagency.com/work/</a>) at a shop that is big enough to bite off important, meaningful work and small enough to have fun doing it and we’re looking for an engineer who is equally at ease talking to clients, designers, producers, and developers about things like scope, resource allocation, solutions to engineering problems, creative ideas for how to build things, ways to articulate technical complexity to normal business humans...and occasionally...cut some code.</p><p><strong>Here’s What We Think You Probably Need to Be Successful At This Job: </strong></p><ul><li>Have agency experience, leading a development team spread across multiple projects and clients.</li><li>Hands on developer and leader</li><li>Are comfortable reviewing project specifications, collaborating with company leadership to develop project estimates and technical specs</li><li>Experienced in code reviews to adhere to best practices and internal standards, providing feedback and following up on remediation</li><li>You have an ear to the ground for new tech, whether it comes from hacker news or a programming subreddit, and a desire to dive in and try it out.</li><li>Experience in architecting and building bespoke custom WordPress themes using Advanced Custom Fields, Gravity Forms, Yoast with custom integrations to third party systems.</li><li>Experience in client and server-side debugging, performance profiling and optimization techniques with an uncanny intuition for finding the cause and solution</li><li>Experience with integration of analytics, a/b testing, and advertising platforms using Google Tag Manager</li><li>Planning out projects in coordination with Project Manager/Producer and Developer team members, participating in project check-ins providing feedback to the team</li><li>Jumping in to assist developers who are in need of aid in implementation and/or troubleshooting of backend or frontend development goals</li><li>Aiding and/or leading bug triage in coordination with Project Manager throughout project and during QA</li><li>Comfortable working with small projects (1 dev) and medium projects (2-3 devs)</li><li>Experienced in concepting high-level architectures and codifying them in visual and written documentation</li><li>Experienced with CI / CD build automation tools such as DeployBot, Jenkins, and Travis CI</li><li>Comfortable in architecting and implementation of APIs in PHP/Laravel, NodeJS/Express and other similar stacks.</li><li>Attention to detail and a seamless user experience. &nbsp;This means making the product look like the design and working with your team to make it smooth and perfect.</li><li>You have real-world experience with React. &nbsp;AngularJS knowledge might be transferable, but React is what we're looking for.</li><li>jQuery is &quot;nice to have&quot; but NOT necessary in your arsenal. &nbsp;You respect the finer points of the browser rendering pipeline and know when to 3D transform (and when NOT to). &nbsp;Oh, and calls to GetComputedStyle make you shudder, especially when jQuery is obfuscating them.</li><li>You do so much Wordpress that you have strongly-held opinions about its future, its architecture, and the &quot;right ways&quot; to build with WP. &nbsp;We keep our stack lean and don't go plugin-heavy.</li><li>You have strong opinions on, and respect for, the design process.</li><li>We mostly do a lot of HTML, CSS, PHP, MySQL and JavaScript -- we keep it lean and get the job done.</li><li>You know your way around configuring a local development environment with help from the Interwebz, of course.</li><li>You know what DevOps is but aren't necessarily a zealot for any one process, technology, or denomination.</li><li>You have a willingness to express yourself through animated gifs and obscure movie quotes from the youtubes.</li><li>You work well at the 11th hour, but even better at the first and second so we can be out by happy hour.</li><li>You're down with remote work. We've got offices in NY / LA but we encourage working from home, from coffee shops, from wherever you feel most comfortable. We've got tools in place to keep communication going online and we love that we can all be in different parts of the country and work together.</li><li>We constantly improve only because we don't bullshit each other or our clients. We don't hide; we don't say what we think others want to hear. We do our work with respect, and we value truth, transparency, and honesty above all else.</li></ul><p>To Apply:&nbsp;</p><p>If you are interested, please apply with a resume and introduction.&nbsp;</p><p>Please feel free to skip the formality of a cover letter and write to&nbsp;me as a human being.&nbsp; If you need to use a four letter word to effectively express a previous engagement or an appropriately inappropriate metaphor to describe your ideal work environment, I’ll take that over what you would think I typically “need to hear” in a job application. Be yourself. The truth is the easiest thing to remember and I don’t have time to weed through cover-letter-speak to find out who you really are and what you want in life.

To stay at the top, we need to be excellent at everything we do, including development.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>On the surface, our development needs look simple, but there’s a lot more going on behind the scenes. In fact, our business is built upon complex development solutions that we’ve created from scratch.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>Right now, we’re looking to expand our team with the best people so we can achieve even more.</span><span></span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span>To attract the most capable developers like you, we’ve created the dream work environment for building your career.</span><br></div><div></div><div></div><div><h2><span><br></span></h2></div><div><h2><span>8 Reasons To Build Your Career As A Developer At iPhone Photography School</span></h2></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><strong> 1. Solve Interesting Problems</strong><br></div><div></div><div></div><div><span>Most of our development solutions are built from scratch and are customized to our needs.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>This includes our payment and upsell system, our online learning platform and iOS app, and our proprietary algorithms that decide how millions of dollars are spent on Facebook ads.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>We have an AWS server set-up with load balancers, we use Docker and Circle CI for continuous integration, and we’ve got automated testing for everything.</span><br></div><div></div><div></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span>The point is, you’ll never be bored working here.</span></div><div><br></div><div><strong>2. Work With A Clean Codebase</strong><br></div><div></div><div></div><div><span>Tell me if this sounds familiar to you: a nice piece of code you’re trying to push seems to be breaking a different part of the system. As you open the problematic code, the first words you utter are “Who the **** wrote this?”</span><br></div><div></div><div></div><div><span></span></div><div><br></div><div><span>We don’t work like that.</span><span></span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span>We spent all of 2017 to clean up our codebase and rarely will you find better kept code. If we touch one part of the system, we make sure it still integrates perfectly with the rest.</span><span></span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span>This long-term approach saves you a lot of frustration and lets you focus on the problem at hand.</span></div><div><br></div><div><strong>3. Endless Opportunities To Grow</strong><br></div><div></div><div></div><div><span>You love being a developer because you experience growth every single day. Each completed task comes with an exciting feeling that you’ve learned something new. This rush makes you want to jump on the next assignment and continue growing.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>We get how important growth is for developers.</span><span></span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span>Want to master a new framework, tool or expand your skill set (e.g., learn about AI and deep learning)? Find the appropriate online course and we’l</span><span>l pay for it.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>Want to use your new skills for real life solutions? We’ll encourage you to do it.</span><span></span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><strong>4. Get Expert Guidance</strong><br></div><div></div><div></div><div><span>Our developers are ninjas. But we don’t expect them to know everything.

To stay at the top, we need to be excellent at everything we do, including development.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>On the surface, our development needs look simple, but there's a lot more going on behind the scenes. In fact, our business is built upon complex development solutions that we've created from scratch.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>Right now, we’re looking to expand our team with the best people so we can achieve even more.</span><strong></strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>To attract the most capable developers like you, we’ve created the dream work environment for building your career.</span></p><h2><span>8 Reasons To Build Your Career As A Developer At iPhone Photography School</span></h2><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>1. Solve Interesting Problems</span></p><p><span>Most of our development solutions are built from scratch and are customized to our needs.</span><strong></strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>This includes our payment and upsell system, our online learning platform and iOS app, and our proprietary algorithms that decide how millions of dollars are spent on Facebook ads.</span><strong></strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>We have an AWS server set-up with load balancers, we use Docker and Circle CI for continuous integration, and we’ve got automated testing for everything.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>The point is, you’ll never be bored working here.</span><strong></strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>2. Work With A Clean Codebase</span></p><p><span>Tell me if this sounds familiar to you: a nice piece of code you’re trying to push seems to be breaking a different part of the system. As you open the problematic code, the first words you utter are “Who the **** wrote this?”</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>We don’t work like that.</span><strong></strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>We spent all of 2017 to clean up our codebase and rarely will you find better kept code. If we touch one part of the system, we make sure it still integrates perfectly with the rest.</span><strong></strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>This long-term approach saves you a lot of frustration and lets you focus on the problem at hand.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>3. Endless Opportunities To Grow</span></p><p><span>You love being a developer because you experience growth every single day. Each completed task comes with an exciting feeling that you’ve learned something new. This rush makes you want to jump on the next assignment and continue growing.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>We get how important growth is for developers.</span><strong></strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>Want to master a new framework, tool or expand your skill set (e.g., learn about AI and deep learning)? Find the appropriate online course and we’l</span><span>l pay for it.</span><strong></strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>Want to use your new skills for real life solutions? We’ll encourage you to do it.</span><strong></strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>4. Get Expert Guidance</span></p><p><span>Our developers are ninjas. But we don’t expect them to know everything. Even the best developers sometimes need expert help to complete the most challenging tasks.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>If there’s something outside of our team’s comfort zone, we provide them with experienced mentors in the particular area.</span><strong></strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>Besides that, you can always get help from other people on the team. They know how to achieve almost anything with code.</span><strong></strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>Join our team, and you’ll get guidance from the top experts in the business.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>5. Stay In Control Over Your Own Time</span></p><p><span>Have you ever experienced this situation: your boss angrily asks you about a feature that had to be launched already… while you had no clue it was a priority?<br></span><strong></strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>You abandon all other tasks and end up working late in the evening to ship the feature – only for a new urgency to come up the next the day... And this cycle repeats itself again and again.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>We do things a little differently.

This involves building pages from scratch based on Illustrator or Sketch designs and making modifications to our WordPress sites. Lately we have been moving towards utilizing static site generators so interest and experience in those will be valued.<br /><br />Your HTML5 & CSS3 skills will shine as you show off optimization and code quality when resolving bugs and issues when they come up. You'll also work at designing and developing better user experiences and measuring the effect on those through A/B tests.<br /><br />We practice good coding standards, we build for the future, and we don't believe in cowboy coding or working in a bubble. We're looking for thinkers ... with talent. We don’t need employees.<br /><br />What you'll be doing day-to-day<br /><br />* Writing code with a focus on performance, speedy page load times, improving conversion rates<br />* Building sites and implementing redesigns, designed in Illustrator/Sketch, on our WordPress or static based sites<br />* Coding features for our sites (both through WP Themes and not) using HTML5/CSS/PHP/JS<br />* Designing and developing better user experiences and measuring the effect on those through A/B tests<br />* Future-proofing our sites with maintenance fixes, updating features, and rolling out responsive, mobile-friendly platforms<br />* Conversing, committing, and delivering via Asana/Slack/GitHub/email (in whatever order that is)<br />* Exploring new technologies/tools for finding solutions to new (and old) problems<br />* Optimizing conversions with A/B testing and Visual Website Optimizer and Google Optimize (yep ... important enough to list here and not with the Pluses below)<br />Application Architecture (things you'll HAVE to know)<br />* Experience with static site generators like Jekyll, Gatsby, or Hugo<br />* Fundamental PHP experience especially as it relates to maintaining WordPress themes and websites<br />* Semantic HTML<br />* Sass, Bourbon, etc. (or other CSS pre-processor)<br />* CSS Frameworks (Bourbon/Neat, Bootstrap, Foundation, etc... we roll our own, btw)<br />* JavaScript & jQuery skills<br />* Experience with build and package management tools like Gulp, Grunt, NPM, Bower, etc<br />* Structured Data (gotta satisfy the Googles)<br />* Advanced understanding of all the cool buzzwords... SEO, Web-standards, accessibility and usability concepts, information architecture, UX & UI design (heavy on the UX)<br />* Good communication skills & a great can-do attitude (We’re totally serious about this one.)<br />* A GitHub account or experience with other version control (SVN, CVS, etc. ... but git/gh is where it's at)<br /><br />Tech Stack<br /><br />html5, css3, javascript, jquery, php, wordpress, git, github, node.js, angular, react, vagrant, npm, bower, bundler, headless, gulp, sass, composer, json, static site generators, jekyll, hugo, go, ruby, algolia<br /><br />Pluses<br /><br />* Chris Coyier is a hero of yours.<br />* You’ve hosted a website with Netlify, Forestry, or a similar service<br />* You have converted a WordPress website to Jekyll, Hugo or another static site<br />* You know the entire CanIUse library inside and out.<br />* You want to teach as much as learn.<br />* You have a pixel-perfect design eye with Photoshop/Illustrator or Sketch skills to match. It’s going to come in super-handy.<br />* You read sites like SmashingMagazine.com and actually put tutorials into practice.<br />* You’ve attended a WordCamp, Meetup, or other industry conference.<br /><br />Human Environment<br /><br />* Centrally located in downtown Houston, free employee parking<br />* Coed work environment, casual dress<br />* Cool office perks (free sodas/Topo Chico/coffee, snacks, etc.)<br />* Generous salary considerations & full benefits<br /><br />What We Value<br /><br />We love to work as a team but office hours are flexible. Producing is more important than meeting a &quot;9 to 5&quot; schedule. We understand there are moments when you need to isolate yourself to concentrate so working from home is permitted and encouraged. We like to have a good time and minimize stress with good in-office coffee, lounge/reading time and regular happy hours. We work hard and meet realistic deadlines. What good is delivering a poor product early?<br /><br />HigherEducation.com builds sites that attract more than 15,000 online student enrollments annually for our university partners.<br /><br />Perks<br /><br />* 401K (up to 6% matched)<br />* Medical, dental, and vision is covered by HigherEducation.com for the employee<br />* Health Savings Account (HSA) and Federal Spending Account (FSA) available<br />* Parking/Public transportation (depending office location)<br />* Paid Time Off<br />* Gym-membership reimbursement<br />* flexible schedule<br />* opportunities to work remotely"

After all, where else would you do it? You only have that one site, so when something needs changing, you do it there.</p><p>However, this practice has several drawbacks. Most of all that it’s very public. So, when something goes seriously wrong, it’s quite noticeable for people on your site.</p><div><h5>Preventing Common Mistakes</h5><p>When creating free or premium WordPress themes, you’re bound to make mistakes.

Most WordPress beginners have done this at one point or another. However, in this article, we want to show you a better way: <strong>local WordPress development</strong>.</p><p>What that means is setting up a copy of your website on your local hard drive. Doing so is incredibly useful. So, below we will talk about the benefits of building a local WordPress development environment, how to set one up and how to move your local site to the web when it’s ready.</p><p>This is important, so stay tuned!</p><h4>The Benefits Of Local WordPress Development</h4><p>Before diving into the <em>how</em>, let’s have a look at the <em>why</em>. Using a local development version of WordPress offers many benefits.</p>      <div>      <div>    <p>Getting the process <em>just</em> right ain't an easy task. That's why we've set up <strong>'this-is-how-I-work'-sessions</strong> — with smart cookies sharing what works really well for them. A part of the <a href='https://www.smashingmagazine.com/membership/' rel='nofollow'>Smashing Membership</a>, of course.</p>      <a href='https://www.smashingmagazine.com/membership/' rel='nofollow'>        Explore features&nbsp;→      </a>      </div>      <div>        <a href='https://www.smashingmagazine.com/membership/' rel='nofollow'>        <div>                  </div>      </a>      </div>    </div>  <div><p>We already mentioned that you no longer have to make changes to your live site with all the risks involved with that. However, there is more:</p><ul><li><strong>Test themes and plugins</strong><br>With a local copy of your site, you can try out as many themes and plugin combinations as you want without risking taking your live site out due to incompatibilities.</li><li><strong>Update safely</strong><br>Another time when things are prone to go wrong are updates. With a local environment, you can update WordPress core and components to see if there are any problems before applying the updates to your live site.</li><li><strong>Independent of an online connection</strong> <br>With your WordPress site on your computer, you can work on it without being connected to the Internet. Thus, you can get work done even if there is no wifi.</li><li><strong>High performance/low cost</strong><br>Because site performance is not limited by an online connection, local sites usually run much faster. This makes for a better workflow. Also, as you will see, you can set it all up with free software, eliminating the need for a paid staging area.</li></ul><p>Sounds good? Then let’s see how to make it happen.</p><h4>How To Set Up A Local Development Environment For WordPress</h4><p>In this next part, we will show you how to set up your own local WordPress environment. First, we will go over what you need to do and then how to get it right.</p><h5>Tools You’ll Need</h5><p>In order to run, WordPress needs a server. That’s true for an online site as well as a local installation. So, we need to find a way to set one up on our computer.</p><p>That server also needs some software WordPress requires to work. Namely, that’s PHP (the platform’s main programming language) and MySQL for the database. Plus, it’s nice to have a MySQL user interface like <a href='https://www.phpmyadmin.net' rel='nofollow'>phpMyAdmin</a> to make handling the database more convenient.</p><p>In addition to that, need your favorite code editor or IDE (<a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment' rel='nofollow'>integrated development environment</a>) for the coding part. My choice is <a href='https://notepad-plus-plus.org/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1515115581629000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEN0VTbppcuZuo1LJsCm94h88UvGA' rel='nofollow'>Notepad++</a> but you might have your own preferences.</p><p>Finally, it’s useful to have some developer tools to analyze and debug your site, for example, to look at HTML and CSS. The easiest way is to use Chrome or Firefox (read <a href='https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2015/12/revisiting-firefox-devtools/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1515115581629000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEBaIBIrWQbtsMeqGx7y_VVSGuwAg' rel='nofollow'>our article on Firefox's DevTools</a>), which have extensive functionality like that built in.</p><h5>Available Software</h5><p>We have several options at our disposal to set up local server environments. Some of the most well known are <a href='https://serverpress.com' rel='nofollow'>DesktopServer</a>, <a href='https://www.vagrantup.com' rel='nofollow'>Vagrant</a>, and <a href='https://local.getflywheel.com' rel='nofollow'>Local by Flywheel</a>. All of these contain the necessary components to set up a local server that WordPress can run on.</p><p>For this tutorial we will use <a href='https://www.apachefriends.org/' rel='nofollow'>XAMPP</a>. The name is an acronym and stands for “cross platform, Apache, MySQL, PHP, Perl”. If you have been paying attention, you will notice that we earlier noted MySQL and PHP as essential to running a WordPress website. In addition, Apache is an open source solution for creating servers. So, the software contains everything we need in one neat package. Plus, as “cross platform” suggests, XAMPP is available for both Windows, Mac and Linux computers.</p><p>To continue, if you haven’t done so already, head over to <a href='https://www.apachefriends.org/' rel='nofollow'>the official XAMPP website</a> and download a copy.</p><h5>How To Use XAMPP</h5><p>Installing XAMPP pretty much works like every other piece of software.</p><p>On Windows:</p><ol><li>Run the installer (note that you might get a warning about running unknown software, allow to continue).</li><li>When asked which components to install, make sure that Apache, MySQL, PHP, and phpMyAdmin are active. The rest is usually unnecessary, deactivate it unless you have good reason not to.</li><li>Choose the location to install. Make sure it’s easy to reach as that’s where your sites will be saved and you will probably access them often.</li><li>You can disregard the information about Bitnami.</li><li>Choose to start the control panel right away at the end.</li></ol><p>On Mac:</p><ol><li>Open the .dmg file</li><li>Double click on the XAMPP icon or drag it to applications folder</li><li>That’s it, well done!</li></ol><p>After the installation is complete, the control panel starts. Should your operating system ask for Firewall permissions, make sure to allow XAMPP for private networks, otherwise, it won’t work.</p>                                        <a href='https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/bf5a4c39-1599-4513-befe-77ff975228bd/08-wordpress-local-development-for-beginners.jpg' rel='nofollow'>Large preview</a>            <p>From the panel, you can start Apache and MySQL by clicking the <code>Start</code> buttons on the respective rows. If you run into problems with programs that use the same ports as XAMPP, quit those programs and try to restart the XAMPP processes. If the problem is with Skype, there is a permanent solution by disabling the ports under <code>Tools</code>&nbsp;→&nbsp;<code>Options</code>&nbsp;→&nbsp;<code>Advanced</code>&nbsp;→&nbsp;<code>Connections</code>.</p>                                        <a href='https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/6fe39b43-041a-4333-9c53-ff121c241939/04-wordpress-local-development-for-beginners.jpg' rel='nofollow'>Large preview</a>            <p>Under <code>Config</code>, you can also enable automatic start for the components you need.</p>                                        <a href='https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/948de10b-9d4b-4c99-a37b-19b91b6f862b/09-wordpress-local-development-for-beginners.jpg' rel='nofollow'>Large preview</a>            <p>After that, it’s time to test your local server. For that, open your browser, and go to <code>http://localhost</code>.</p><p>If you see the following screen, everything works as it should. Well done!</p>                                        <a href='https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/904e73d5-b228-4b1f-9e4e-1a20dfc6cc31/13-wordpress-local-development-for-beginners.jpg' rel='nofollow'>Large preview</a>            <h5>Installing WordPress Locally</h5><p>Now that you have a local server, you can install WordPress in the same way that you do on a web server. The only difference: everything is done on your hard drive, not an FTP server or inside a hosting provider’s admin panel.</p><p>That means, to create a database for WordPress, you can simply go to <code>http://localhost/phpmyadmin</code>. Here, you find the same options as in the online version and can <a href='https://codex.wordpress.org/Installing_WordPress%23Using_phpMyAdmin&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1515115581640000&amp;usg=AFQjCNH3rSK4UbV8xEIaM1dljQBLws-5cg' rel='nofollow'>create a database, user and password for WordPress</a>.</p>                                        <a href='https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/71515eed-1c79-4679-973a-b982e763fbab/12-wordpress-local-development-for-beginners.jpg' rel='nofollow'>Large preview</a>            <p>Once that is done and you want to install WordPress, you can do so via the <code>htdocs</code> folder inside your installation of XAMPP. There, simply create a new directory, download <a href='https://wordpress.org/latest.zip' rel='nofollow'>the latest version of WordPress</a>, unpack the files and copy them into the new folder. After that, you can start the installation by going to <code>http://localhost/newdirectoryname</code>.</p>                                        <a href='https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/c49d899e-13f3-4bb6-8f44-5c32084ee860/01-wordpress-local-development-for-beginners.jpg' rel='nofollow'>Large preview</a>            <p>That’s basically it. Now that you have a running copy of WordPress on your website, you can install themes and plugins, <a href='https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2016/01/create-customize-wordpress-child-theme/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1515115581642000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFL2cAnqRYIkUGPS-RHJnio9PBSzg' rel='nofollow'>set up a child theme</a>, change styles, <a href='https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2015/06/wordpress-custom-page-templates/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1515115581643000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFXUp0Byb1NFqpe11VErK7KEEkR_A' rel='nofollow'>create custom page templates</a> and do whatever your heart desires.</p><p>When you are satisfied, you can then move the website from a local installation to live environment. That’s what we will talk about next.</p><h4>How To Deploy Your Site With A Plugin</h4><p>Alright, once your local site is up to your liking, it’s time to get it online. Just a quick note: if you want to get a copy of your existing live site to your hard drive, you can use the same process as described below only in reverse. The overall principles stay the same.</p>  <div></div><p>Either way, we can <a href='https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2013/04/moving-wordpress-website/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1515115581644000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHffat6-FHejgiPDdPd570-xVpd7g' rel='nofollow'>do this manually</a> or via plugin and there are several solutions available. For this tutorial, we will use <a href='https://wordpress.org/plugins/duplicator/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1515115581644000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFDZDm0iLZ9c8rX5ArHpJJEKO9DmQ' rel='nofollow'>Duplicator</a>. I found it to be one of the most convenient free solutions and, as you will see, it makes things really easy.</p><h5>1. Install Duplicator</h5><p>Like every other WordPress plugin, you first need to install Duplicator in order to use it. For that, simply go to <code>Plugins</code>&nbsp;→&nbsp;<code>Add New</code>. In the search box, input the plugin name and hit enter, it should be the first search result.</p>                                        <a href='https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/f17f7da8-b800-405a-8834-ef8b8c7b7c0a/05-wordpress-local-development-for-beginners.jpg' rel='nofollow'>Large preview</a>            <p>Click <code>Install Now</code> and activate once it’s done.</p><h5>2. Export Site</h5><p>When Duplicator is active on your site, it adds a new menu item in the WordPress dashboard. Clicking it gets you to this screen.</p>                                        <a href='https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/26d61da4-d53a-4e96-a764-1f2378e0cabe/14-wordpress-local-development-for-beginners.jpg' rel='nofollow'>Large preview</a>            <p>Here, you can create a so-called package. In Duplicator that means a zipped up version of your site, database, and an installation file. To get started, simply click on <code>Create New</code>.</p><p>In the next step, you can enter a name for your package. However, it’s not really necessary unless you have a specific reason.</p>                                        <a href='https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/648cc3d6-34ac-4e8c-a55d-c4d0b75c1fc6/10-wordpress-local-development-for-beginners.jpg' rel='nofollow'>Large preview</a>            <p>Under <code>Storage</code>, <code>Archive</code>, and <code>Installer</code> are options to determine where to save the archive (works for the Pro version only), exclude files or database tables from the migration and input the updated database credentials and new URL.</p><p>In most cases you can just leave everything as is, especially because Duplicator will attempt to fill in the new credentials automatically later. So, for now just hit <code>Next</code>.</p><p>After that, Duplicator will run a test to see if there are any problems.</p>                                        <a href='https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/8e347651-30dd-421a-add9-87e61a1079a5/07-wordpress-local-development-for-beginners.jpg' rel='nofollow'>Large preview</a>            <p>Unless something major pops up, just click on <code>Build</code> to begin building the package. This will start the backup process.</p><p>At the end of it, you get the option to download the zip file and installer with the click on the respective buttons or with the help of the <code>One-Click Download</code>.</p>                                        <a href='https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/d5f2d0fc-2ef2-443b-aff5-063ccc4eb7f1/02-wordpress-local-development-for-beginners-800w.jpg' rel='nofollow'>Large preview</a>            <p>Do so and you are done with this part of the process.</p><h5>3. Upload And Deploy Files On Your Server</h5><p>If all of this has gone down without a hitch, it’s now time to upload the generated files to their new home. For that, log into your FTP server and browse to your new site’s home directory. Then, start uploading the files we generated in the last step.</p><p>Once done, you can start the installation process by inputting <code>http://yoursite.com/installer.php</code> into the browser bar.</p>                                        <a href='https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/3734fa20-6b01-441f-bf23-faa79b34cb6e/11-wordpress-local-development-for-beginners.jpg' rel='nofollow'>Large preview</a>            <p>In the first step, the plugin checks the archive’s integrity and whether it can deploy the site in the current environment. You also get some advanced options that you are welcome to ignore at the moment. However, make sure to check the box where it says “I have read and accept all terms and notices,” before clicking <code>Next</code>.</p><p>Your site is now being unpacked. After that, you get to the screen where it’s time to input the database information.</p>                                        <a href='https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/656b14d8-a681-417c-9bfe-1023c51ee813/03-wordpress-local-development-for-beginners.jpg' rel='nofollow'>Large preview</a>            <p>The plugin can either create a new database (if your host allows it) or use an existing one. For the latter option, you need to set up the database manually beforehand. Either way, you need to input the database name, username, and password to continue. Duplicator will also use this information to update the <code>wp-config.php</code> file of your site so that it can talk to the new database. Click <code>Test Database</code> to see if the connection works. Hit <code>Next</code> to start the installation of the database.</p><p>Once Duplicator is done with that, the final step is to confirm the details of your old and new site.</p>                                        <a href='https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/0778e278-426c-4d04-ab95-26036d53f55a/16-wordpress-local-development-for-beginners.jpg' rel='nofollow'>Large preview</a>            <p>That way, Duplicator is able to replace all mentions of your old URL in the database with the new one. If you don’t, your site won’t work properly. If everything is fine, click the button that says <code>Next</code>.</p><h5>4. Finishing Up</h5><p>Now, there are just a few more things to do before you are finished. The first one is to check the last page of the setup for any problems encountered in the deployment.</p>                                        <a href='https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/ce355de3-ea88-484f-bb05-8c9be6012120/06-wordpress-local-development-for-beginners.jpg' rel='nofollow'>Large preview</a>            <p>The second is to log into your new site (you can do so via the button). Doing so will land you in the Duplicator menu.</p>                                        <a href='https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/fbdffc60-0943-4a6f-bfdf-8cb75b81d7b5/15-wordpress-local-development-for-beginners.jpg' rel='nofollow'>Large preview</a>            <p>Here, be sure to click on <code>Remove Installation Files Now!</code> at the top. This is important for security reasons.</p><p>And that’s it, your site should now be successfully migrated. Well done! You have just mastered the basics of local WordPress development.</p><h5>Quick Note: Updating Your Database Information Manually</h5><p>Should the Duplicator plugin for some reason be unable to update <code>wp-config.php</code> with the new database information, your site won’t work and you will see a warning that says “unable to establish database connection”.</p><p>In that case, you need to change the information manually. Do this by finding <code>wp-config.php</code> in your WordPress installation’s main folder. You can access it via FTP or a hosting backend like cPanel. Ask your provider for help if you find yourself unable to locate it on your own.</p><p>Edit the file (this might mean downloading, editing and re-uploading it) and find the following lines:</p><pre><code>/** The name of the database for WordPress */define('DB_NAME', 'database_name_here');/** MySQL database username */define('DB_USER', 'username_here');/** MySQL database password */define('DB_PASSWORD', 'password_here');/** MySQL hostname */define('DB_HOST', 'localhost');</code></pre><p>Update the information here with that of your new host (by replacing the info between the ' '), save the file and move it back to your site’s main directory. Now everything should be fine.</p><h4>WordPress Local Development In A Nutshell</h4><p>Learning how to install WordPress locally is super useful. It enables you to make site changes, run updates, test themes and plugins and more in a risk-free environment. In addition to that, it’s free thanks to open source software.</p><p>Above, you have learned how to build a local WordPress environment with XAMPP. We have led you through the installation process and explained how to use the local server with WordPress. We have also covered how to get your local site online once it’s ready to see the light of day.</p><p>Hopefully, your takeaway is that all of this is pretty easy. It might feel overwhelming as a beginner at first, however, using WordPress locally will become second nature quickly. Plus, the benefits clearly outweigh the learning process and will help you take your WordPress skills to the next level.</p><p>What are your thoughts on local WordPress development?
