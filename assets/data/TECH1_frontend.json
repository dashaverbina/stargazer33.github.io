Elastic is the leading software provider for making structured and unstructured data usable in real time for search, logging, security and analytics use cases. Since its initial release in 2012, Elastic's products have achieved more than 100 million cumulative downloads. Today thousands of organizations like Cisco, eBay, Dell, Goldman Sachs, Groupon, HP, Microsoft, Netflix, NY Times, Uber, Verizon, Yelp, and Wikipedia use the Elastic Stack, X-Pack, and Elastic Cloud to power critical systems that drive new revenue opportunities and massive cost savings. Elastic is backed by $104 million in funding from Benchmark Capital, Index Ventures, and NEA; has headquarters in Amsterdam and Mountain View, California; and has employees across 30+ countries into one coherent team, while the broader community spans across over 100 countries.</p><p><strong>Kibana is the window into the Elastic Stack</strong></p><p>Kibana lets users visualize their Elasticsearch data and navigate the Elastic Stack, so they can do anything from learning why they’re getting paged at 2:00 a.m. to understanding the impact rain might have on their quarterly numbers. Kibana gives users the freedom to select the way they give shape to their data. And they don’t always have to know what they’re looking for. With its interactive visualizations, users start with one question and see where it leads them. Kibana core ships with the classics: histograms, line graphs, pie charts, sunbursts, and more. They demonstrate the full aggregation capabilities of Elasticsearch.</p><p>Are you a top Javascript developer who wants to add to Kibana and X-Pack? We want to meet you!</p><p><strong>Engineering Philosophy</strong></p><p>Engineering a highly complex distributed system that is easy to operate via elegantly designed APIs is a non-trivial effort. It requires solid software development skills, and more importantly, a sharp mind and the ability to think like a user. We also care deeply about giving you full ownership of what you’re working on. Our company fundamentally believes great minds achieve greatness when they are set free and are surrounded and challenged by their peers, which is clearly visible in our organization. At Elastic, we effectively don’t have a hierarchy to speak of. We feel that anyone needs to be in the position to comment on truly anything, regardless of his or her role within the company.</p><p><strong>Responsibilities</strong></p><ul><li>Innovate, lead and contribute to front end and visualization experience of the Kibana and other UI products using JavaScript</li><li>Collaborate with other development teams, quality engineering team, and documentation team to execute on product work</li></ul><p><strong>Skills &amp; Requirements</strong></p><ul><li>Strong JavaScript programming skills</li><li>7+ years of front end development work</li><li>Experience with one modern MVC style JS Framework</li><li>Experience writing automated tests</li><li>Ability to work in a fast paced start-up environment</li><li>Excellent verbal and written communication skills, a great teammate with strong analytical, problem solving, debugging and troubleshooting skills</li><li>Strong preference for operational experience</li><li>Strong preference for knowledge of building complex data visualization and related tooling</li><li>Strong preference for Open Source experience</li></ul><p><strong>Additional Information</strong></p><ul><li>Deeply competitive pay, medical, dental, vision, disability, benefits</li><li>Stock options</li><li>Catered lunches, snacks, and beverages in most offices</li><li>An environment in which you can balance great work with a great life</li><li>Passionate people building great products</li><li>Employees with a wide variety of interests</li><li>Your age is only a number.

Our team works remotely from all over the world.</div><div><br></div><div>Our sole focus is building an application called <a href='http://www.cliniko.com' rel='nofollow'>Cliniko</a>. Cliniko makes life easy for Allied Health professionals by handling appointment scheduling, storing treatment notes and a bunch of other things. It's quite a neat system and is used globally by tens of thousands of people every day.</div><div><br></div><div>Things we love to do:</div><ul><li>Provide great software and service.</li><li>Work with talented people.</li><li>Delight our customers.</li><li>Make the world a little bit better.</li></ul><div><br></div><div><span>HOW WE WORK<br></span></div><div>We work smarter, not harder. We think work/life balance is important and we work a 30-hour week as standard (you still get a full-time pay; it’s a full-time position).</div><div><br></div><div>Even though we're based out of Melbourne, Australia, our team is spread around the world. We want to hire the best person available, not just the best person within a 10km radius. You can see our team's locations on the <a href='http://www.redguava.com.au/' rel='nofollow'>Red Guava</a> website.</div><div><br></div><div>If you want to know more about how we work (which really is quite different), our founder Joel gave a <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_2jXqzxBNU' rel='nofollow'>talk</a> about it.</div><div><br></div><div><span>THE JOB<br></span></div><div>We are looking for an amazing software developer to join our team. This  doesn’t mean  you need to have 5+ years experience in the industry, we care about skill, passion and integrity much more than credentials.</div><div><br></div><div><span>WHO YOU ARE<br></span></div><div>You are a software developer presumably, otherwise your chance of success for this role is quite low.</div><div><br></div><div>You love to code and for your work to have a positive impact. You want to have fun and  enjoy yourself. You want to constantly improve.</div><div><br></div><div>You're comfortable working in at least a few of these:</div><ul><li>CSS</li><li>DOM</li><li>Client side JS</li><li>JSON APIs</li><li>Web frameworks</li><li>Relational databases</li><li>Redis/Sidekiq</li></ul><div><br></div><div>Experience with Ruby on Rails, Angular JS and React are quite a bonus, but not required.</div><div><br></div><div><span>WHAT YOU'LL WORK ON<br></span></div><div>You’ll spend your time developing Cliniko. Things you might be doing include:</div><ul><li>Adding new features to Cliniko.</li><li>Improving existing features.</li><li>Fixing bugs.</li><li>Refactoring code.</li><li>Making Cliniko faster.</li><li>Anything else you think needs doing.</li></ul><div><br></div><div>Basically, you'll be making Cliniko better for our customers.</div><div><br></div><div><span>GREAT WORK ENVIRONMENT<br></span></div><div>We want people doing their best work with us. We know that needs a great work environment, and we don't just mean a flashy office. Some things we do a little differently to enable people to do their best work and live a happy life:</div><ul><li>30-hour work week</li><li>Complete autonomy</li><li>Work whenever you want</li><li>Work from anywhere</li><li>Unlimited annual leave (minimum 4 weeks per year)</li><li>Supplied computer equipment</li><li>Ergonomic furniture</li><li>Fresh organic fruit weekly to your home</li><li>Overseas trips for full team meetups (family invited and paid for too)</li><li>No managers</li><li>No meetings</li></ul><div><br></div><div><span>IN SUMMARY<br></span></div><div>Let’s be clear, you do need to be seriously amazing. We are a small team and we want to keep it that way, we don't hire often. We will offer you the best job you have ever had with plenty of perks, but we expect you to be  super-talented.</div><div><br></div><div>You should be absolutely passionate about building great software.  You should take pride in your work and be excited to share it with our  users.</div><div><b><br></b></div><div><b>Job applications close 18th July 2018.</b></div>  </div>  <div>    <h4>Apply for this position</h4>    <p>Read the how to apply section at <a href='https://jobs.lever.co/redguava/960bdf6d-0731-490e-981b-becf83492a17' rel='nofollow'>https://jobs.lever.co/redguava/960bdf6d-0731-490e-981b-becf83492a17</a> and then click the apply button!</p>  </div>"

You turn on your monitor and join the hangout for your daily Standup. Call done, you hit play on your favourite playlist, tap the volume key a few times and get in the zone. There are some GitHub PRs you need to review, so you head there first. The rest of the morning goes by working on that feature for the weekly client demo tomorrow. Lunchtime arrives so you head to your Yoga class. Feeling stretched and relaxed, you make yourself something to eat, grab (another) cup of coffee and get back to work. Some remote problem solving with the team and then it’s back to code. Hunger calls (where did the day go) and you know it’s time to shut the laptop. After catching up on everyone's day you go pack for your trip to NodeConf the next day.</p><p><strong><strong>What you’ll be doing</strong></strong></p><p>At nearForm, we work with international clients who are industry leaders in their respective fields.

We’re looking for a senior full-stack developer with a willingness to acquire deep expertise around Ruby, Python, and React.js, in order to help us expand to support additional new high-tech sectors.</p><p>Analytics Fire is a small, distributed team working on a range of interesting projects. For example, last year we worked on a scalable IoT platform for utility grade solar power plants, a sales and design tool for residential solar, and a machine-learning powered autonomous cleaning robot. We’re looking for a fun, reliable, and highly collaborative, senior dev to join our team.</p><p>For reference, here is a list of technologies and tools we are currently actively using on a day-to-day basis:</p><ul><li>Front-end: JavaScript / React / Angular</li><li>Back-end: Ruby / Python / Node.js</li><li>Embedded (IoT): C, Embedded Linux, MQTT</li><li>Embedded (robotics): C/C++, ROS</li><li>Modern software techniques: RESTful APIs, SOA, PaaS, etc</li><li>Agile collaboration and DevOps tools: Github, Trello, Slack, Chef, Ansible, Docker, Vagrant, etc</li><li>Occasionally we need to do a small amount of work around: SFDC, iOS, Android, ARKit</li></ul><p>This is a remote position.

We don’t want your typical ugly enterprise app: it has to be elegant, delightful to use, and enticing during&nbsp;a&nbsp;demo.</p><p>As well as a magnificent web front-end, you’ll be working with Microsoft’s Office 365 JS API &amp; Office Fabric to build document editing services right into the Word app.</p><p>Our clients will generally&nbsp;be financial firms in the world’s leading financial centers, primarily New York City and London. You may need to travel occasionally, but not often.<br><br>We don’t care about prior experience in our industry (fintech); frankly we’d love it if you came from a design agency or other non-enterprise background. We want someone to build a wonderful&nbsp;user experience, and you can learn about the business domain while doing so.</p><p><strong>YOUR RESPONSIBILITIES</strong><br>You’ll be doing some or all of the following:</p><ul><li>working with our product manager to refine the UI/UX requirements</li><li>coding the front-end for the web and Office apps</li><li>writing some basic test packs. We won’t go overboard but we aren’t flying by the seat of our pants, either</li><li>in partnership with the CTO, the technical lead, and the rest of your team, defining and implementing standards for how we work: our agile methodology, coding standards, development tools, deployment practices, and more. This is a green field development and we want to use tomorrow’s best practices today.<br><br></li></ul><p><strong>WHO WE WANT</strong> <br>We are looking for a smart person with initiative and good judgment, who works well with others, and who will always look to balance the urgent needs of clients with the long-term technical architecture for our product.</p><p><em>You need to have:</em></p><ul><li>excellent verbal and written communication skills</li><li>an eye for good design. You won’t be getting detailed wireframes, so your role will be at least partly that of a designer</li><li>a minimum of three years’ experience using client-side web technologies with a solid knowledge of HTML5 and CSS3, preferably gained from working at a design agency or product company</li><li>experience with ReactJS and knowledge of Node JS and webpack, as well as a unit testing framework such as Jest</li><li>prior experience working in agile&nbsp;</li><li>a pragmatic, get-it-done approach to things developers often don’t like e.g. writing tests, updating documentation, and talking to clients</li><li>a desire to learn new things. For example, we have a Ruby on Rails API, so there is an opportunity for someone who has good front end skills to become a full stack developer.</li></ul><p>A degree in Comp Sci or equivalent is great, but it’s not essential. It’s most important that you have good coding &amp; design skills.</p><p><em>Any of these things will help you stand out:</em></p><ul><li>opinions – preferably grounded in knowledge and experience&nbsp;</li><li>experience on a team that has implemented a good continuous integration strategy (or if not, an awareness of the benefits of these strategies so you can champion them within the role)</li><li>Office 365 JS API experience would be wonderful (we know it’s a bit niche)</li><li>experience with Bootstrap or similar – we’ll be using Office Fabric, a similar library from Microsoft</li><li>working with RESTful API back-end components</li><li>development of a SaaS web product&nbsp;</li><li>experience working within a distributed development model i.e. with people in other locations and time zones. We’ll mostly be Belfast-based, but we may use specialists in other places such as sales engineers in London and New York.&nbsp;<br><br></li></ul><p><strong>WHAT WE OFFER</strong></p><p>Salary is dependent on your experience&nbsp;and skillset.&nbsp;As well as the basics - competitive pay and benefits – we offer work on a greenfield product, in a small startup-like team.

You are likely to <strong>learn and grow as a developer</strong> while working here.</li><li>Our pay and benefits will be somewhere between good and great, depending on what you are used to and where you live (see below for specifics).</li><li>You will have the option of <strong>working from home or our office</strong>, whatever suits you best. Let’s make the most of our time and minimize commuting when not necessary.</li><li>We have a no-drama office policy. We value and cultivate enjoyable working relationships among team members.</li><li>We emphasize work/life balance and adopt policies that make sure our people don’t get burnt out. For instance, our PTO/Vacation policies are <strong>designed so that you actually use them.</strong></li><li>A commitment to Agile Principles while not being enslaved to any particular methodology.</li><li>You have the skills and experience to be a mid-level or senior level full-stack web application developer. That is, you need to be able to architect &amp; run with a medium sized project mostly on your own.</li><li>You like building full stack web applications with technologies like Python, React, SQL, etc.</li><li>You are <strong>committed to automated testing</strong> of all the software you write (our apps typically have 92%+ test coverage).</li><li>You recognized that there is a lot of idealism in the software development community and are not disenchanted with the the <a href='https://ukiahsmith.com/blog/programming-is-terrible-so-learn-to-enjoy-it/' rel='nofollow'>day-to-day realities of programming</a>.</li><li>You like working independently but can contribute to a team as needed</li><li>If you apply, we will give you a yay or nay response. No black holes here!</li></ul><p><strong>Daily Responsibilities</strong></p><p>Daily responsibilities primarily consist of coding database-driven web applications and other web-related development work. In a typical day, you will likely work mostly with Python based web applications using frameworks like Django or Flask that interact heavily with a database (PostgreSQL or MSSQL).&nbsp; In the course of that work, you will have to interact with related technologies like JavaScript, React, HTML, and CSS/SASS.</p><p>This is not a design job. It will require a lot of in-depth programming and database work including the ability to architect maintainable code that gets the job done.</p><p>While we do prefer to do most of our back-end work in Python, we will occasionally take projects in other languages if they seem to be a good fit for us and the customer.</p><p>Some days you will jump from project to project as issues come up. At other times you may work primarily on one project for weeks or months.</p><p>The ability to take ownership for a project, engineer a sound technical solution, and “drive” a project to completion is <strong>essential</strong>.</p><p>Our customers have varied needs and so we tend to have varied responsibilities and projects. We have a focus on serving the customer and making software conform to their company rather than making the company conform to software.</p><p>We run our teams (two currently) in two week sprints.</p><p><strong>What We Offer</strong></p><ul><li>Pay: $75-$100K (mid-level), $100K-125K (Senior/Lead).<br><ul><li>We are happy to talk about money as one of the first parts of our conversation so we don’t waste each others time if we aren’t in the ballpark.</li><li>Everyone wants to be paid as much as possible, but the economics of business usually require that we meet in the middle.</li><li>Our offer will take into consideration your salary history, experience, references, and a skills assessment.</li></ul></li><li>Profit Sharing: In addition to a salary, our employees will earn a bonus based on how profitable our company is each year (roughly $1-2K annually).</li><li>One of the best things about working for us is that we really value work/family balance.<ul><li>We rarely work more than 40 hours a week.</li><li>We recently gave everyone an extra day off for Valentine’s Day just for extra quality time with their family.</li><li>We know there are devs out there putting in 50-60 hours a week. We can give them 10-20 hours a week of their life back.</li></ul></li><li>PTO/Vacation:<ul><li>Everyone receives 3 weeks of PTO/Vacation per year.</li><li>Up to 12 sick days per year.</li><li>9 Holidays</li></ul></li><li>Healthcare: We contribute to an HRA to offset the cost of health insurance or healthcare expenses.</li><li>Flexibility: While we expect a regular schedule during normal business hours, we are pretty flexible when schedule changes are needed for legitimate reasons.</li><li><strong>Telecommuting</strong>:<ul><li>Remote candidates are welcome to apply.</li><li>Many of us work from home frequently, even those of us who are local.</li><li>We do have an office if you prefer to get away from home to focus on work.</li></ul></li><li>We Care: It’s easy to say, harder to do. We all need to make a living, our company needs to be successful in the marketplace, and hard decisions sometimes need to be made. But, at the end of the day, we really care about our employees, their families, their needs, and their desires.</li></ul><p><strong>Full Job Description &amp; Application Instructions<br></strong></p><p>Above are just highlights.

Accordingly, the reputation of Level 12 and the character of our employees is of utmost importance. You <strong>do not</strong> need to share our leadership's religious convictions, but you will need to share our commitment to the following principles:</p><ul><li><strong>Integrity</strong>: honest, trustworthy, reliable, ethical. We have high moral standards and we expect our employees to share those standards. If you use pirated software or media, don’t mind “tweaking” the truth, or think `porn == entertainment`, this is not the job for you!</li><li><strong>Good work ethic</strong>: you work hard and like to work hard.

    "content": "h1. For developers, insurtech is the playground you never knew you wanted. <br /><br />We’re taking on big, never-before-solved problems with new technologies - all while fully funded and facing massive growth in a stable, wealthy industry.<br /><br />When you join us, we’ll kit you out with a full spec Macbook Pro, likely set you up to pair with another developer and get you into the codebase as quickly as possible. As a startup, we need you to be curious, tenacious and driven, constantly looking for new and better ways to build our complex product using new and better processes, tools, frameworks, whatever it takes.<br /><br />In our small team there is enormous scope to have your say, to influence how we work, what we work on and, ultimately, what Wrisk will become for our future millions of international users. And we'll offer you some ownership in the business, so you'll share in every success ahead of us.<br /><br />h2. What you’ll do<br /><br />As a full stack developer you will take features from start to finish, collaborating with others as you go. You will be often required to turn your hand to something new, possibly something you have not done before; you might pair with a specialist in areas where we have in-house expertise or following industry best practices from your own research. <br /><br />You'll be working very closely with CTO Alex to build out a micro-services architected platform - the engine that powers the Wrisk app. This platform integrates with many clients from our own app to external data sources and third party solution providers, so there's a lot to do. <br /><br />Applications are written Kotlin, so demonstrable experience creating production quality JVM based applications is pretty much essential. If you've worked on delivering a mobile friendly RESTful API that would be a bonus, and if that has led you to thinking of tools like Dropwizard and Swagger, all the better. <br /><br />You should have some demonstrable experience using a modern JavaScript technology to build user facing applications. We currently use React/Redux for some of our internal web applications and are migrating our Swift mobile application to React Native so any experience with RN is a huge plus.<br /><br />Finally, you’ll be deploying the apps you’ve written to our environment in AWS. You should be familiar with Infrastructure As Code and containerisation using technologies such as Terraform and Docker.<br /><br />h2. How you’ll work<br /><br />While what you work on is well-structured and organised, how you work is up to you. The office is relaxed, with flexible working available to everyone. You’ll meet with your whole team every morning (remotely by video if you’re away from the office) followed by a quick tech huddle, but other than that your time is your own. If you want to take 10 minutes to clear your head with meditation, a trip to a local hipster coffee shop or a game of table tennis - go for it. Nobody’s clock-watching. We just care that the work gets done, to a high standard, on time.<br /><br />We believe in, and practice, the Lean ideas of build/measure/learn, and will be very happy to show you the kanban storyboard you will be building from. You will participate in, and often lead, our retrospectives, as well as presenting at the bi-weekly showcases, to the wider team, which are essential for ensuring we are all on the same page.<br /><br />We typically start with a workshop to define what we need to achieve, leading to wireframes and perhaps some high level tasks. We refine and test until we believe we have the core of what we want and then we build the smallest amount we can to validate this - sometimes in code, sometimes in prototype. We do regular user testing, rapid prototyping and code spikes to ensure we only build the most-right thing we can right now.<br /><br />h2. What you’ll get<br /><br />Our future actually looks even rosier from inside the company, where we can see what’s on the roadmap and who’s expressed an interest in us. We already have investment and support from some major partners. We’re going places - and we want you with us. You'll help build the path that gets us there, with some equity of your own so you’re properly rewarded when we arrive.<br /><br />We also offer a competitive salary, 30 days holiday allowance (with public holidays on top) and flexible working conditions. We're currently based in Techspace Shoreditch, a short walk from Old Street. Our offices are modern and bright, with the startup-essential posh coffee and ping pong table, as well as indoor bicycle parking and shower."

An ambitious goal, PatientPal automates several difficult tasks that are still mostly human-run today. Through automation we’re improving efficiency, reducing errors and mistakes, and saving clinics and patients time and money. Unfortunately, it is not simple to automate healthcare, so PatientPal is a very goal-oriented company.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>We are a small, early stage team looking for great developers who want to join a passionate team and make a difference in healthcare. We focused on keeping PatientPal affordable for our customers and keeping PatientPal robust, flexible, low cost to operate, and therefore affordable to a wide array of clinics, providers, hospitals, and professionals.</span></div><div><br></div><ul><li>We are completely serverless. Relying on modern FaaS, we scale instantly and maintain a low operating cost. Experience with Lambda, DynamoDB, or similar technologies is a plus.</li><li>We are HIPPA compliant. This requires training and requires us to handle data securely. We provide training, but experience or knowledge in encryption, network security, information assurance is a plus.</li><li>We integrate with a lot of services. Rather than recreate, we integrate. We work with lots of APIs, services, and medical industry protocols that will jar the mind of most modern developers. Experience using deprecated APIs, working with difficult integrations that lack documentation, or direct experience with using medical industry standards such as HL7, FHIR, CDA, CCD, X12, DICOM, EDI, and similar protocols is a major plus.</li><li>We are building a modern tool, that is easy to use. The frontend application is in Angular 6. Experience with Angular or similar frontend frameworks is a plus.</li><li>We are accessible to any patients. PatientPal cares about the patient experience. Experience building international, multilingual, and accessible applications is a plus.</li><li>We rely on high quality, self-tested work. We do not have a QA team, but we have a lot of automated testing. An ideal candidate will experience writing unit tests, end-to-end tests, and testing their own work.</li><li>We are a distributed, fully remote team. There are no core hours. Our culture is passion. If you need someone to keep you focused, we are not the team for you. If you get work done without asking, can make suggestions that can improve a product, love taking ownership in your work, and are looking for a team with extremely capable engineers who all feel the same then PatientPal is for you.</li></ul><div><br></div><div><span><b>The ideal candidate should:</b></span></div><div><br></div><ul><li>Be passionate about their work above all else. It's okay to mess up, but it's important to own it, grow, and be better for the future.</li><li>Be able to work across all aspects of the application, from database indexes, backend code, testing, frontend, deployment, mobile. If it needs to be done, then you should be capable of figuring it out.</li><li>Be capable of learning new things. The technology we use, the APIs we need to work with, most of the team may not have worked with these things. We don't expect anyone to come in with existing knowledge of everything, so we expect every team member to be capable and interested in learning, solving problems, and be capable of creating something wonderful.</li><li>Be capable of self-directed work. Find a problem, fix it. The team has priorities, you should know what they are and work to help get it done. You should never have to ask if it's worth fixing something or what's the next ticket you should grab is. If it's not obvious to you, then you're out of sync with the team.</li><li>Not be afraid to refactor. Sometimes code is shit and you just need to do it. We're working with a lot of crappy, legacy technologies. We all want to make it better, we're not going to wait around for someone else to do it.</li></ul><div><br></div><div><span>We are looking to build something incredible. To do so, we expect our team members are here because they want to help us do so.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span><b>Our interview process is this:</b></span></div><div><br></div><ol><li>Interview call, see if our passion aligns (about 20 minutes).</li><li>Technical call, see if you possess the skills to drive change (about 30 minutes).</li><li>Paid work day! We'll pay you for a full day of work, you'll get info to access our repo in advance and will be expected to sign an NDA. We'll pay you $200 for the day, flat. If you pass, we'll send you a job offer. During this day, we'll expect you to be online, working through an actual ticket, ideally making PRs. We're an async team, but we'll have people online working with you regardless of your personal timezone. At the end of the day you'll do a call to go over how the day went and what you got done.</li></ol><div><br></div><div><span><b>Perks of PatientPal:</b></span></div><div><span><br></span></div><ol><li>Work that you can feel good about.<br></li><li>No commutes!<br></li><li>Dress code freedom!<br></li><li>Vacation, holidays, and time off.<br></li><li>Flexible hours<br></li><li>Lots more to come!</li></ol>  </div>  <div>    <h4>Apply for this position</h4>    <p>Send your info and a resume to <a href='mailto:resumes@patientpal.health' rel='nofollow'>resumes@patientpal.health</a>We're looking for direct hires, we're not interested in consulting groups.</p>  </div>"

You probably understand that while it’s not “hard”, it is different. &nbsp;There is a different kind of social aspect to working remotely.  Sometimes you need to find a way to just talk to people. &nbsp;In a typical week, you’ll jump on some Zoom calls now and then to get some face time with other humans and decide what to work on, keep in touch via Slack and occasional voice calls. &nbsp;But above all you can communicate about story cards with devs and non-devs asynchronously, and then have code that makes sense to the rest of the team.  </span></div><div><br></div><div><span>You’ll build front facing sites, microsites, landing pages...you know...HTML/CSS/JavaScript that work with our core application and with our integration partners and integration customers. BotCheck:&nbsp; Tell me what your favorite fiction book is within your e-mail.&nbsp; I promise to acknowledge your submission right away.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>These are some examples of the things you can work on here. &nbsp;Don’t let anything be a deal breaker for you, you don’t have to work on “all” of it. Use your current goto skills to deliver value and then dabble into the some of the other interesting areas:</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>Since we have a core product, core API, partners that we integrate with and and customers that we integrate with and provide some customization for, on a given day, you might wind up choosing a card to work on any of these:</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>Our core product front end, back end or APIs. &nbsp;It’s a Rails app with VueJS and Postgres, hits a Gateway API with GraphQL that sits on top of our Graph Database microservices. &nbsp;Our core product interfaces with a dozen 3rd party APIs and our growing list of internal APIs.  One of our big internal APIs hits our A.I. product called Mathison. &nbsp;Our head of A.I. has a Ph.D. in Artificial Intelligence and is always looking to find new ways to apply it to our customers data.  Any experience with data science, machine learning or AI is a bonus but certainly not an expectation.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>We have a set of products that utilizes javascript, a Rails set of services and various 3rd party API integrations to embed content into&nbsp; websites. &nbsp;(You’ve seen our stuff, you just didn’t know it was ours.)&nbsp; Think of our core products as a Enterprise Headless CMS, Marketing Automation and A.I.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>We are constantly looking to make our workflow better and our architecture nicer to work with. &nbsp;The current alphabet soup of our tech stack is: Rails, Ruby, Python, JavaScript, VueJS, GraphQL, Gremlin Graph Database, Tensorflow, Elixir and Phoenix, Redis and lots of NodeJS and of course all of the front end usual suspects like React / VueJS / Gatsby / Ruby / Jekyll / JavaScript.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>If you’ve worked remotely and have front end experience with a flair for design then send us a note with a resume or some reasonable facsimile of one, a **link or two to things you are proud of working on**. &nbsp;A real person who wrote this ad, will receive your email, look at what you sent and actually respond provided that you are not a bot and just scraped this to automagically send your resume. :-)</span></div><div><br></div>  </div>  <div>    <h4>Apply for this position</h4>    <p>If you’ve worked remotely and have production experience then send us a note with a resume or some reasonable facsimile of one, a link or two to things you are proud of working on and a paragraph about why you think this is interesting enough.

    "content": "<p>Ballotpedia, the online encyclopedia of American politics, informs people about politics by arming them with accurate, <a href='https://ballotpedia.org/Why_neutrality%3F' rel='nofollow'>objective information</a>, for all levels of government.</p><p>Our coverage doesn’t start and end with Congress and the White House. We don’t stop at state legislatures or at the Texas Railroad Commissioner. We cover school boards, city councils, and county ballot measures.</p><p>Ballotpedia goes so local that we are able to provide 20% of United States citizens with a complete sample ballot. To do that, we need to write a lot of articles. So far, we’ve written over a quarter of a million articles on elected officials, candidates, influencers, elections, and more, all researched and written by our amazingly dedicated professional staff.</p><p>Ballotpedia was founded more than 10 years ago, in 2007. Since then we’ve had over 870 million page views, and <a href='https://ballotpedia.org/Ballotpedia:What_people_are_saying' rel='nofollow'>we’ve been referenced</a> in over 5,000 media outlets. From the <em>New York Times</em>, <em>Wall Street Journal</em>, and <em>Politico</em> to <em>Daily Kos</em> and <em>Breitbart</em>. Come November, you’ll find Ballotpedia.org among the top 200 most-visited sites in the United States.</p><p><strong>The Position</strong></p><p>Ballotpedia’s tech team is looking for a talented full-stack web developer to join us in making high-quality political data and unbiased journalism available to the American public. Our team is small, which brings some challenges, but also the opportunity for your work to truly make an impact. We work to support and improve all aspects of Ballotpedia’s web presence, including our main website, API, internal reports, and public tools (such as our Sample Ballot Lookup). Our current stack is jQuery, Bootstrap, MediaWiki, PHP, MySQL, and AWS, but we are planning to transition some of our applications to Node and Postgres in the coming months. We use git for code versioning, Docker for local testing, Asana for task management, and Slack and Google Hangouts for communication.</p><p>Occasional evening/weekend work may be required, especially when deploying new software or monitoring our systems at high-traffic times. This position reports to our Tech Manager and will work closely with our two other developers.</p><p><strong>Assignments</strong></p><p>Day-to-day activities of the web developer will include a mix of smaller technical tasks such as troubleshooting a bug reported by a website visitor, writing and running a script to update some content on several hundred website pages, or doing a database query to find and fix an error in our API data. In addition, the web developer will be making progress on long-term tech objectives, such as adding features to our API (per our roadmap), coding new tools (like an app for exploring historical election results), or building out a new Node app.</p><p><strong>Skills and Qualifications</strong></p><p>The ideal candidate will come from a technical background and have two (or more) years of experience with the technologies in our stack. However, we equally value personal traits such as candor, excellence, teamwork, self-improvement, a servant mindset, a sense of humor, and the ability to learn new tech quickly.</p><p><strong>Environment</strong></p><p>The web developer will work remotely from their home location. All Ballotpedia staff work remotely. Ballotpedia uses Google Applications (Gmail, Google Calendar, Drive and more).</p><p>Ballotpedia is a results-only work environment (ROWE). A ROWE is a workplace in which every employee is 100% accountable to the results and 100% autonomous over their time. ROWE workplaces have been shown to provide better service to the ultimate customer of the business while also improving employee engagement and work satisfaction. Each employee will be oriented to the principles of a ROWE during new employee training.</p><p><strong>Compensation</strong></p><p>Ballotpedia’s compensation package is competitive. In addition to your salary, Ballotpedia offers bonuses based on performance and a $6,500 annual benefits stipend, which may be used to pay for a full benefits package, including health, vision, and dental insurance; life insurance; and more. If benefits are not elected, the $6,500 stipend is taxed as regular income and added to your regular compensation.</p><p>Additional information can be found in the <a href='https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1pqAt0Aaxxj3lawZCgVcY3Dx1zoIizS9vTgmTPLHk9WM/edit' rel='nofollow'>Ballotpedia Guidebook</a>.</p>"

Analysts using our geospatial visualization capability can instantly visualize and publish for data discovery and model testing on any desktop, mobile or tablet device.</p><p><strong>Who We Need</strong></p><p>Cultural Fit - While we hire all kinds of people and invent roles to fit them, there are three key traits we require of every team member that really define our team.</p><ol><li>&nbsp;Fun to Work With - Life is short and work should be fun. &nbsp;</li><li>&nbsp;Extremely Smart - We work on cutting edge hard problems and we need people who can both architect and code these systems at the same time while working with a highly intelligent peer group. &nbsp;</li><li>Passionate Engineers - We need people who really love programming and exhibit the energy and creativity that comes from being fully engaged in what you do.</li></ol><p><strong>Skills &amp; Requirements</strong></p><p><strong>Types of Roles</strong></p><p>We need talented people to help add cool new features to our platform. &nbsp;Below are the general categories of tasks we are working on, but often people straddle multiple areas so take them more as the general &quot;gist&quot; of what you might do with us. We are looking for smart, hard working, fun people and we will invent the right role to fit them. &nbsp;The key trait we are looking for is people who like to both architect/design and write the code for complex systems. &nbsp;</p><p><strong>(1) Client Side - </strong>Interactive Visuals: We maintain a JavaScript API for for interactive Data Visualization using our high performance web services. We need people both to help add new dynamic animated UI components and other features to the JS API. We also need people to build data driven visuals for our demo gallery if you are artistically or data analysis inclined. Enjoy working with Knockout, Angular, D3.js, HTML5? Check our our galleries to see the kind of stuff you will be working on <a href='http://maplarge.com/demos' rel='nofollow'>http://maplarge.com/demos</a></p><p><strong>(2) Full Stack Web Services -</strong> Full stack developers who are comfortable working on both client and server side to produce high performance applications powered by scalable web services are the backbone of our team. &nbsp;We run c# in both .net and mono server side and also maintain a flexible client side API with a large library of reusable components. We host and run large deployments that sometimes scale to thousands of computers for scientific/industrial/gov users and in a typical day process data over 15 billion records from 110 million streaming data sources. &nbsp;</p><p><strong>(3) Algorithm / Core Database Development - </strong>&nbsp;We built our own in memory database and distributed data analytics pipeline from the ground up with funding from DARPA, and we have a team of really talented researchers working on Pattern analysis, Streaming analytics, Spatial queries and Network graph functions that power our visual engines. We are always looking for practical people who love writing highly optimized code that straddles the line between research and software development. We don't usually publish scientific papers, but we are right out on the edge pulling algorithms out of the latest research papers finding really fast &quot;good enough&quot; approaches that let us tease interesting patterns out of data without getting lost in &quot;science experiment land&quot;</p><p><strong>Requirements:</strong></p><ul><li>US Person based anywhere in the US (100% remote allowed but no off shore)</li><li>5 Years work experience as a programmer</li><li>Highly Comfortable with C# and Visual Studio</li><li>Experienced with Web Development &amp; JavaScript</li></ul>                </div>                                    <div>                                    <div>                                        <div>        <a href='https://stackoverflow.com/jobs/apply/124860?reset=False&amp;ra=FScjxUoprcQ&amp;oqs=a%3DFScjxUoprcQ' rel='nofollow'>Apply now</a></div>                                                <div>                                                    <a rel='nofollow'>Ask a question</a>                                                                                                        </div>                                    </div>                        </div>        </div>            <h2>About MapLarge</h2>            <div><p>MapLarge provides Big Data Analytics and Visualization to make us safer, more productive, and more efficient. &nbsp;&nbsp;Our platform powers high traffic website visualizations, data discovery, and business intelligence applications.

We take pride in a neat codebase with automated tests and continuous integration, and encourage constant refactoring. We encourage new ideas and experimentation. No part of the code base is off limits.</p><p>Our current technologies include modern versions of Ember, React, TypeScript, ASP.NET MVC, C#, and F#. We also rely on tools such as AWS, GitHub, TeamCity, Octopus Deploy, Sumo Logic, Datadog, and New Relic.

You will help us shape the digital guest experience for restaurant brands served by Olo. You will contribute to technology selection, architecture and user experience for our front-end applications.</p><p>Any engineer may work at Olo’s headquarters in New York City’s Financial District or remotely from anywhere in the U.S. In fact, more than half of our engineering team is remote!</p><p><strong>Requirements</strong></p><ul><li>Experience building user interfaces that put users first and look and feel awesome to use</li><li>Deep knowledge of ES6/ES2015+ and one or more modern Javascript frameworks, with a preference for React or Ember</li><li>Demonstrable understanding of the full .NET web stack</li><li>Leadership experience that spans one or more aspects of technology selection, architecture and design oversight, and mentoring others</li><li>Superb problem solving skills with an emphasis on pragmatism, quality, and performance</li><li>Passion for learning new skills and technologies</li><li>Excellent collaboration skills</li><li>BS degree in a technical field of study, or equivalent practical experience</li><li>Working proficiency and communication skills in verbal and written English</li><li>Legal right to work in the U.S</li></ul>                </div>                                    <div>                                    <div>                                        <div>        <a href='https://olo.applytojob.com/apply/AzhBQUv0Ml/FrontEnd-Engineer-JavaScript-NET?source=StackOverflow' rel='nofollow'>                        Apply now        </a></div>                                    </div>                        </div>        </div>            <h2>About Olo</h2>            <div><p>Olo reaches millions of consumers by powering mobile and online ordering for many of the country’s largest restaurant chains.

Running a platform with multiple white-labeled front-ends, that maintains real-time connections into thousands of restaurants’ POS systems, and coordinates complex transactions between these and other third parties (such as payment gateways and gift card providers) is not for the faint of heart!</p><p>Olo is located at 26 Broadway in the historic Standard Oil Building, the former home of John D. Rockefeller. &nbsp;We offer great benefits, such as 20 days of Paid Time Off, fully paid health, dental and vision care premiums, stock options, a generous parental leave plan, and perks like FitBits, rotating craft beers on tap in our kitchen, and food events featuring our clients' menu items (now you know why we give out FitBits!).

We’re looking for a senior full-stack developer with a willingness to acquire deep expertise around Ruby, Python, and React.js, in order to help us expand to support additional new high-tech sectors.</span></p><p><span>Analytics Fire is a small, distributed team working on a range of interesting projects. For example, last year we worked on a scalable IoT platform for utility grade solar power plants, a sales and design tool for residential solar, and a machine-learning powered autonomous cleaning robot.

We’re flexible about location and hours, so long as your working hours are in a very heavily US-overlapping time zone (eg: North America, Central America, South America, etc). We’re a really great match for a senior dev in a US-overlapping timezone who wants to work hard on interesting projects, while also having flexibility around time and geography.</span></p><p><strong><strong>Skills &amp; Requirements</strong></strong></p><p><span>Ideally, you should have 5+ years commercial full stack development, ideally within a startup environment. You should be comfortable autonomously driving your own high quality / high velocity contributions using a range of technologies.</span></p><p><span>We work with a variety of technologies, but are currently specifically looking for someone that has or can obtain expert level skills around Python, Ruby, and React.js.</span></p>                </div>                                    <div>                                    <div>                                        <div>        <a href='https://stackoverflow.com/jobs/apply/136187?reset=False&amp;ra=JFIBXryxPKo&amp;oqs=a%3DJFIBXryxPKo' rel='nofollow'>Apply now</a></div>                                                <div>                                                    <a rel='nofollow'>Ask a question</a>                                                                                                        </div>                                    </div>                        </div>        </div>            <h2>About Analytics Fire</h2>            <div><p><span>Analytics Fire was founded by a couple of data-nerds -- one a PHd in machine learning and the other a former VP of Engineering for an analytics platform -- who both are also serial entrepreneurs backed by prominent angels and VCs including Y Combinator and 500 Startups.</span></p><p><span>“Our goal founding, Analytics Fire, was to create the engineering department that we always dreamed of working for.

<div><p><strong>The No-Bullshit-iest Way We Can Describe This Job In The Least Amount Of Words In A Run-On Sentence: </strong></p><p>We build a lot of different kinds of stuff for a lot of different kinds of folks (<a href='https://sanbornagency.com/work/' rel='nofollow'>https://sanbornagency.com/work/</a>) at a shop that is big enough to bite off important, meaningful work and small enough to have fun doing it and we’re looking for an engineer who is equally at ease talking to clients, designers, producers, and developers about things like scope, resource allocation, solutions to engineering problems, creative ideas for how to build things, ways to articulate technical complexity to normal business humans...and occasionally...cut some code.</p><p><strong>Here’s What We Think You Probably Need to Be Successful At This Job: </strong></p><ul><li>Have agency experience, leading a development team spread across multiple projects and clients.</li><li>Hands on developer and leader</li><li>Are comfortable reviewing project specifications, collaborating with company leadership to develop project estimates and technical specs</li><li>Experienced in code reviews to adhere to best practices and internal standards, providing feedback and following up on remediation</li><li>You have an ear to the ground for new tech, whether it comes from hacker news or a programming subreddit, and a desire to dive in and try it out.</li><li>Experience in architecting and building bespoke custom WordPress themes using Advanced Custom Fields, Gravity Forms, Yoast with custom integrations to third party systems.</li><li>Experience in client and server-side debugging, performance profiling and optimization techniques with an uncanny intuition for finding the cause and solution</li><li>Experience with integration of analytics, a/b testing, and advertising platforms using Google Tag Manager</li><li>Planning out projects in coordination with Project Manager/Producer and Developer team members, participating in project check-ins providing feedback to the team</li><li>Jumping in to assist developers who are in need of aid in implementation and/or troubleshooting of backend or frontend development goals</li><li>Aiding and/or leading bug triage in coordination with Project Manager throughout project and during QA</li><li>Comfortable working with small projects (1 dev) and medium projects (2-3 devs)</li><li>Experienced in concepting high-level architectures and codifying them in visual and written documentation</li><li>Experienced with CI / CD build automation tools such as DeployBot, Jenkins, and Travis CI</li><li>Comfortable in architecting and implementation of APIs in PHP/Laravel, NodeJS/Express and other similar stacks.</li><li>Attention to detail and a seamless user experience. &nbsp;This means making the product look like the design and working with your team to make it smooth and perfect.</li><li>You have real-world experience with React. &nbsp;AngularJS knowledge might be transferable, but React is what we're looking for.</li><li>jQuery is &quot;nice to have&quot; but NOT necessary in your arsenal. &nbsp;You respect the finer points of the browser rendering pipeline and know when to 3D transform (and when NOT to). &nbsp;Oh, and calls to GetComputedStyle make you shudder, especially when jQuery is obfuscating them.</li><li>You do so much Wordpress that you have strongly-held opinions about its future, its architecture, and the &quot;right ways&quot; to build with WP. &nbsp;We keep our stack lean and don't go plugin-heavy.</li><li>You have strong opinions on, and respect for, the design process.</li><li>We mostly do a lot of HTML, CSS, PHP, MySQL and JavaScript -- we keep it lean and get the job done.</li><li>You know your way around configuring a local development environment with help from the Interwebz, of course.</li><li>You know what DevOps is but aren't necessarily a zealot for any one process, technology, or denomination.</li><li>You have a willingness to express yourself through animated gifs and obscure movie quotes from the youtubes.</li><li>You work well at the 11th hour, but even better at the first and second so we can be out by happy hour.</li><li>You're down with remote work. We've got offices in NY / LA but we encourage working from home, from coffee shops, from wherever you feel most comfortable. We've got tools in place to keep communication going online and we love that we can all be in different parts of the country and work together.</li><li>We constantly improve only because we don't bullshit each other or our clients. We don't hide; we don't say what we think others want to hear.

You can live and work where you’re happiest, but you need to have a US work permit to join the team. This position is available to begin immediately.</strong></p><p><strong>Your experience</strong></p><p>You should have at least 5 years of professional experience writing clean, semantic, standards-compliant HTML and CSS. Additionally, you should have experience working with a JavaScript library like jQuery to manipulate the document, handle events, or create small animations. The code that you write should be modular, efficient, and easy to understand by other developers. The ideal candidate is ready and willing to learn and grow with us.</p><p>We expect you to be good at the technical stuff but your most critical skill is communication. Since our team is remote, we communicate through Slack, Basecamp, and video chats throughout the day. You must be able to express your ideas and needs clearly to both team and clients.</p><p>Finally, you’ll be working in a deadline-based environment and you need to be a fantastic self-manager.

If you have experience integrating your code with other server-side templating tools, that is very useful.</li><li>Check in your code to a versioning system like Subversion or Git.</li><li>Test a website in various browsers and mobile devices. Then make style adjustments for cross-browser compatibility.</li><li>Investigate and resolve 15-20 reported bugs ranging from small text edits to image updates to JavaScript errors to display inconsistencies.</li><li>Communicate directly with a client in Basecamp to answer a question or give a status update.</li><li>Build an HTML email template for use in Campaign Monitor.</li><li>Work with a Technical Project Manager to create a time estimate for a new feature of an existing project or for a totally new project.</li></ul><p><strong>Your technical skills need to include:</strong></p><ul><li>HTML, CSS, Javascript, JQuery, and various Javascript frameworks</li><li>Experience with dynamic CSS preprocessors such as SASS and LESS</li><li>Experience working with Gulp and Webpack</li><li>You are comfortable building templates that will be integrated with server-side code</li><li>Document and organize your code so future developers can update it</li><li>Experience working with the Bootstrap framework</li><li>Familiarity working in an integrated development environment (IDE) like Visual Studio</li><li>Experience using Litmus to verify that your email templates look as good as possible in different email clients</li><li>Experience using Browserstack or another multi browser testing platform to ensure designs are responsive</li><li>Experience in Vue and Backbone is a plus</li></ul><p><strong>Benefits and such</strong></p><p>We Are Mammoth is a closely-knit, remote team software developers, designers, technical project managers, and support staff based throughout the United States.</p><p>Every full time employee has access to our medical/dental/vision coverage, life insurance, short- and long-term disability programs, and an employer-matched retirement plan with company matching up to 3%.</p><p>Everyone starts with 15 days of paid vacation. Each year, you’ll get 5 more until you have 25 paid vacation days.</p><p>All new team members at We Are Mammoth are paired with a mentor who provides advice, guidance, and support.</p><p><em>This is a contract-to-hire, remote, front-end web developer position. Your initial contract will be 3 months (at a monthly rate of pay agreed upon prior to work start), and subsequent full-time employment is at the discretion of both We Are Mammoth and yourself.</em></p></div></div><div></div></div></div></div><div><a href='http://statcounter.com/' title=&quot;web statistics&quot; rel='nofollow'></a></div>"

Along with the other developers Helena, Zac and Tom (CTO), you’ll be responsible for developing new features, keeping our site up, fixing bugs and ensuring our codebase easy to develop and progress. You’ll also have a chance to collaborate across the wider team to develop internal tooling and help with their projects.<br /><br />Our site is currently comprised of a small number of Node.js services covering: universally rendering our React UI, our API business logic and PDF rendering. We also have a number of other small, custom internal services (e.g. slackbot, Trello API integrations, CS tools) that help the rest of the team do their jobs.<br /><br />*ABOUT FAREWILL*<br /><br />At Farewill, we’re out to change the way the world deals with death. Helping people to take control, personally and financially, of what matters to them after they’re gone.<br /><br />We launched our first product - our will-writing service - in December 2016, and since then we’ve grown to be the largest will-writer in the UK.<br /><br />Our growth to date has been driven by an exceptional product (&quot;see our customer reviews&quot;:https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/farewill.com) and key strategic partnerships. We’ve been featured in Forbes, The Times, The Guardian and on &quot;Radio 4&quot;:https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b08slvk6 among others. We're also making waves in the charity world - with over £45 million raised for charities on our platform from gifts left in wills.<br /><br />*OUR TEAM*<br /><br />We’re a creative, focused team who love what we do. We have backgrounds in design, technology, behavioural psychology, and management consultancy. We love to learn from each other and our customers, and grow together as a team.<br /><br />Based in Haggerston, we’re backed by some of the best investors in Europe - from the founders of Zoopla and Wonga, to Kindred Capital, SAATCHiNVEST, JamJar and The Daily Mail & General Trust.<br /><br />This is an unusual, fascinating, and emotional area to work in – if you’re up for a big challenge we’d love to meet you. You can find out more about our team &quot;here&quot;:https://farewill.com/about.<br /><br />*ABOUT YOU*<br /><br />You have a sound understanding of modern Javascript and its ecosystem, and are able to use this to creatively solve problems.

    "content": "At PassFort, we share a powerful vision to enable businesses & individuals to establish trust online. We’re connecting the human concept of trust with the transformative technology of the internet.<br /><br />We currently do this by giving businesses the tools they need to automate and digitalise the onboarding, verification and management of their customer relationships - that means customers can be onboarded in real-time, from the comfort of their own home. <br /><br />Nowhere are these tools more necessary than in regulated markets - where compliance with regulations, such as anti-money laundering (AML) and know your customer (KYC), have for too long been a sinkhole for product, engineering & compliance resource and customer goodwill.<br /><br />And this is just the beginning - our long term aim is to bring together all aspects of your identity into a digital passport that can be used securely and interchangeably online. We're transforming how trust is established online, in the same way that Salesforce transformed sales, Stripe transformed payments and AWS transformed DevOps.<br /><br />What you’ll be doing<br /><br />We’re looking for talented full stack engineers ready to make an impact. <br /><br />You’ll work with a great modern stack - including ES6 and React on the front-end, and Python and Rust on the back-end. We have a microservice based architecture built on top of Kubernetes and Google’s Cloud Platform. <br />We empower our team to have ownership across the entire product. You’ll think about everything from architecture, security and performance, all the way through to feature UX. You’ll be developing  entire features, including technical design, implementation and release. <br /><br />You’ll be comfortable working across the code base, and learning new technologies as the business requires - you might prefer a back or front end focus, but you’ll be open to a working knowledge of both.<br /><br />We’ll trust (and depend!) on you to speak up, voice your opinion, and respectfully challenge. You’ll have the chance to bring new ideas, and become an integral part of the process to continuously improve our product, along with our working practices. We think everyone can teach us something - and offer mentorship to more junior members. <br /><br />What we’re looking for<br /><br />We like to keep it simple<br />* Foremost, we’ll be looking for someone who fits well with our company culture and values - Trust, Empowerment and Growth<br />* You’ll need a deep knowledge of either Python, Rust, or Javascript (we use React), and at least a desire to learn the others.<br />* Specialised experience in any of the following areas would be a plus - DevOps (Kubernetes), Security, UX and design<br /><br />The Perks<br /><br />* Equity! We want you to succeed as we do<br />* Great location - we’re central to three stations, and sandwiched between Brick Lane and Spitalfields market<br />* An annual learning & development budget to spend on professional or personal development, we’re invested in both<br />* Birthday off - relax and put your feet up<br />* Dental cover<br />* Access to Perkbox - discounts to services and products (and honestly it’s fantastic)<br />* Equally Enhanced Maternity/Paternity/Shared Leave pay <br />* Generous holiday entitlement<br />* Pension contributions - investing in your future is important<br />* Pick your own equipment and kit<br />* Biscuits… we’re a bit obsessed. We have a weekly ‘guest’ biscuit to broaden your biscuit horizons.<br /><br />Check out our careers site to get more insight into our team, and company culture and values! <br />https://jobs.passfort.com/jobs/105219-fullstack-developer<br />"

Our current system was built using Ionic v1, it was built as a prototype and has had new functionality bolted on since then - to be honest, it's full of cruft! Ionic v1 is now end of life, and as we've also been working on a web-based version of OLIO, built on top of React, then now makes complete sense to start migrating our existing mobile apps to React Native so we can share as much code as possible.</p><p>Technologies with work with are:</p></li><li><p>React / React Native  </p></li><li><p>Redux / Thunks</p></li><li><p>JavaScript / ES6 / Babel</p></li><li><p>Service workers</p></li><li><p>CSS / SCSS</p></li><li><p>Internationalisation </p></li><li><p>Travis CI (we also buld docker images based off this)</p></li><li><p>Automated builds</p></li><li><p>Material design / Apple design guidelines</p></li><li><p>Google play metrics / App Store metrics</p><p>We'd love to play with lots more technology (machine learning / AI) and so more staff means we also get more time to experiment and learn. Have a good idea, tell us about it, and if it makes sense you'll get a chance to work on it. </p><p>In return you'll get to work with a great team (aren't we all?), a great amount of autonomy, unlimited holiday allowance, flexible/remote working (UK only right now I'm afraid), ownership in what you build, and knowing each day that you are making a huge difference.</p><p>You'll be working with APi developers, designers, a product team, and providing instantly useful features for our internal team (therefore the community at large). We're a small, passionate team, and we're growing rapidly so you'll not only be involved heavily in the product but also the culture of the company at a very early stage. We release when a feature is ready for our users and not to some strict and repeating schedule.</p><p>If you haven't heard of us, we're the world's only neighbour-to-neighbour food sharing app, and we've recently been featured in Apple's WWDC closing video, on BBC World Hacks, on Jamie &amp; Jimmy's Friday Night Feast, and in publications all over the world. We get so much good publicity because what we are doing is <em>so</em> obvious  and <em>so</em> important.</p></li></ul>"

<div><p><strong>The No-Bullshit-iest Way We Can Describe This Job In The Least Amount Of Words In A Run-On Sentence: </strong></p><p>We build a lot of different kinds of stuff for a lot of different kinds of folks (<a href='https://sanbornagency.com/work/' rel='nofollow'>https://sanbornagency.com/work/</a>) at a shop that is big enough to bite off important, meaningful work and small enough to have fun doing it and we’re looking for an engineer who is equally at ease talking to clients, designers, producers, and developers about things like scope, resource allocation, solutions to engineering problems, creative ideas for how to build things, ways to articulate technical complexity to normal business humans...and occasionally...cut some code.</p><p><strong>Here’s What We Think You Probably Need to Be Successful At This Job: </strong></p><ul><li>Have agency experience, leading a development team spread across multiple projects and clients.</li><li>Hands on developer and leader</li><li>Are comfortable reviewing project specifications, collaborating with company leadership to develop project estimates and technical specs</li><li>Experienced in code reviews to adhere to best practices and internal standards, providing feedback and following up on remediation</li><li>You have an ear to the ground for new tech, whether it comes from hacker news or a programming subreddit, and a desire to dive in and try it out.</li><li>Experience in architecting and building bespoke custom WordPress themes using Advanced Custom Fields, Gravity Forms, Yoast with custom integrations to third party systems.</li><li>Experience in client and server-side debugging, performance profiling and optimization techniques with an uncanny intuition for finding the cause and solution</li><li>Experience with integration of analytics, a/b testing, and advertising platforms using Google Tag Manager</li><li>Planning out projects in coordination with Project Manager/Producer and Developer team members, participating in project check-ins providing feedback to the team</li><li>Jumping in to assist developers who are in need of aid in implementation and/or troubleshooting of backend or frontend development goals</li><li>Aiding and/or leading bug triage in coordination with Project Manager throughout project and during QA</li><li>Comfortable working with small projects (1 dev) and medium projects (2-3 devs)</li><li>Experienced in concepting high-level architectures and codifying them in visual and written documentation</li><li>Experienced with CI / CD build automation tools such as DeployBot, Jenkins, and Travis CI</li><li>Comfortable in architecting and implementation of APIs in PHP/Laravel, NodeJS/Express and other similar stacks.</li><li>Attention to detail and a seamless user experience. &nbsp;This means making the product look like the design and working with your team to make it smooth and perfect.</li><li>You have real-world experience with React. &nbsp;AngularJS knowledge might be transferable, but React is what we're looking for.</li><li>jQuery is &quot;nice to have&quot; but NOT necessary in your arsenal. &nbsp;You respect the finer points of the browser rendering pipeline and know when to 3D transform (and when NOT to). &nbsp;Oh, and calls to GetComputedStyle make you shudder, especially when jQuery is obfuscating them.</li><li>You do so much Wordpress that you have strongly-held opinions about its future, its architecture, and the &quot;right ways&quot; to build with WP. &nbsp;We keep our stack lean and don't go plugin-heavy.</li><li>You have strong opinions on, and respect for, the design process.</li><li>We mostly do a lot of HTML, CSS, PHP, MySQL and JavaScript -- we keep it lean and get the job done.</li><li>You know your way around configuring a local development environment with help from the Interwebz, of course.</li><li>You know what DevOps is but aren't necessarily a zealot for any one process, technology, or denomination.</li><li>You have a willingness to express yourself through animated gifs and obscure movie quotes from the youtubes.</li><li>You work well at the 11th hour, but even better at the first and second so we can be out by happy hour.</li><li>You're down with remote work. We've got offices in NY / LA but we encourage working from home, from coffee shops, from wherever you feel most comfortable. We've got tools in place to keep communication going online and we love that we can all be in different parts of the country and work together.</li><li>We constantly improve only because we don't bullshit each other or our clients. We don't hide; we don't say what we think others want to hear. We do our work with respect, and we value truth, transparency, and honesty above all else.</li></ul><p>To Apply:&nbsp;</p><p>If you are interested, please apply with a resume and introduction.&nbsp;</p><p>Please feel free to skip the formality of a cover letter and write to&nbsp;me as a human being.&nbsp; If you need to use a four letter word to effectively express a previous engagement or an appropriately inappropriate metaphor to describe your ideal work environment, I’ll take that over what you would think I typically “need to hear” in a job application. Be yourself. The truth is the easiest thing to remember and I don’t have time to weed through cover-letter-speak to find out who you really are and what you want in life. Just tell me.</p>                </div>                                    <div>                                    <div>                                        <div>        <a href='https://stackoverflow.com/jobs/apply/192578?reset=False&amp;ra=12AfxD422agE&amp;oqs=a%3D12AfxD422agE' rel='nofollow'>Apply now</a></div>                                                <div>                                                    <a rel='nofollow'>Ask a question</a>                                                                                                        </div>                                    </div>                        </div>        </div>            <h2>About Sanborn</h2>            <div><p>We're a 25-person interactive shop working with all manner of organizations (sports teams, beauty brands, magazines, non-profits, pharmaceutical companies, startups) helping to create and manage the full battery of digital media goodness (web, mobile, content, video and experiential activations to be specific).</p><p>We believe passionate, talented people all working together smoothly yields awesome work that lets us come back and do it again tomorrow.&nbsp;</p><p>Some more about where we stand as a company:&nbsp;<a href='https://sanbornagency.com/about/' rel='nofollow'>https://sanbornagency.com/about</a></p><p><strong>About Our Engineering Team:&nbsp;</strong></p><ul><li>The team is made of folks who seem to enjoy bouncing in and out of different projects of different sizes with varying engineering challenges associated with them.&nbsp;<br><br></li><li>Our designers are highly technical and our engineers are very invested in the visual fidelity of their work - so some of the lines that typically divide UI/UX and engineering cultures don't really exist here.&nbsp;<br><br></li><li>At any one given time we'll have folks on longer term missions (ie - 6 to 8 month long-term projects where we're in more of a product development posture) and people on shorter term campaign-based work where we're trying to explode a firecracker in the sky, measure how far and bright it travels, and then move onto to the next one.&nbsp;<br><br></li><li>We try to keep plates of work varied and diversified.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br></li><li>Everyone is a grownup.&nbsp;</li></ul>            </div>                            <h2>Benefits</h2>                    <ul>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Remote work friendly environment.</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Full health benefits package.</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Brooklyn, Manhattan, and Los Angeles office locations.</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Shithead eco-flush system ensuring shitheadless working environment.</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Family owned and operated.</span>                            </li>                    </ul>                "

But what if we applied the user-centered design process to ourselves, our lives, and our careers?                            </p>    </div>    <div>        <h6>Table of Contents</h6>        <div></div>    </div></div>        <div>  <div>    <div>      <a href='http://smashed.by/membercounter' rel='nofollow'></a>    </div>      <div>      <h3>Members support Smashing</h3>    </div>  </div>  <p><em>Wonderful</em>, friendly people who keep this lil' site alive — and <strong>get smarter</strong> every&nbsp;day.</p>  <a href='http://smashed.by/membercounter' rel='nofollow'>Are you smashing, too?&nbsp;→</a></div>                   </div>            <div>                <div>    </div>                <p>Everything is designed, whether we make time for it or not. Our smartphones and TVs, our cars and houses, even our pets and our kids are the products of purposeful creativity.</p><p>So why not our lives?</p><p>A great many of us are, currently, in a position where we might look at our jobs — or even our relationships — and wonder, “Why have I stayed here so long? Is this really where I want or even <em>need</em> to be. Am I in a position where I can do something about it?”</p><p>The simple — and sometimes harsh — the answer is that we don’t often make intentional decisions about our lives and our careers like we do in our work for clients and bosses. Instead, having once made the decision to accept a position or enter a relationship, inertia takes over. We become reactive rather than active participants in our own lives and, like legacy products, are gradually less and less in touch with the choices and the opportunities that put us there in the first place.</p><p>Or, in UX terms: We stop doing user research, we stop iterating, and we stop meeting our own needs. And our lives and careers come less usable and enjoyable as a result of this negligence.</p><p>Thankfully, all the research, design, and testing tools we need to intentionally design our lives are easily acquired and learned. And you don’t need special training or a trust fund to do it.

In many ways, people have been practicing this iterative process since our ancestors first talked to each other and sketched on cave walls. Call it design thinking, UX, or simply problem-solving — it’s much the same from agency to agency, department to department, regardless of the proprietary frame.</p><a href='https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/bb237c59-3aae-45b2-b63a-fc7353f019aa/process.gif' rel='nofollow'></a><strong>Look familiar?</strong> The design process in its simplest form.Credit: <a href='https://thenounproject.com/icon/147184/' rel='nofollow'>Christopher Holm-Hansen, thenounproject.com</a>.

This research is also used to align user and business needs with what’s technically and economically feasible. This first step in the process is tremendously freeing — you don’t need to toil in isolation. Your user knows what they need, and this research will help you infer it.</li><li><strong>Phase 2: Design</strong><br>Don’t just make things beautiful — though beauty is joyful! Focus on creating solutions for the specific needs, pain-points, and opportunities your research phase identified. And remember, design is both a noun and a verb. Yes, you deliver designs for your clients, but design is — first and foremost — a process of insight, trial, and error. And once you have a solution in mind...</li><li><strong>Phase 3: Testing</strong><br>Test early and test often. When your solutions are still low-fi (before they go to development) and <em>absolutely</em> before they go to market, put them in front of real users to make sure you’re solving the right problems. Become an expert in making mistakes and iterating on the lessons those mistakes teach you. It’s key to producing the best solutions.</li><li><strong>Repeat</strong></li></ol><p>Most design-thinking literature illustrates how the design process is applied to products, software, apps, or web design. At our agency, <a href='http://www.importantshit.co/' rel='nofollow'>J+E Creative</a>, we also apply this process to graphic design, content creation, education, and filmmaking. And it’s for that reason we don’t call it the UX design process. We drop the abbreviated adjective because, in our experience, the process works just as well for presentations and parenting as it does for enterprise software.</p><p>The process is about problem-solving. We just have to turn the process on ourselves.</p><h4>Expanding The Scope: User-Centered Parenting</h4><p>As creatives and as the parents of five elementary-aged kiddos, one of the first places we tried to apply the design process to our lives was to the problems of parenting.</p>    <a href='https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/7a43a5f1-643f-4648-bba2-4d30d0a319c9/shark-lego.jpg' rel='nofollow'>            </a>                        <strong>Talk about a pain point.</strong> Using UX basics to solve a parenting problem opened the door to a wider application of the process and — mercifully — saved our tender feet.

They’re all right angles, unshatterable plastic, and invariably in places where you otherwise feel safe, like the kitchen or the bathroom.</p><p>But how can you research, design, and test a parenting issue — such as getting kids to pick up their Legos — using the user-centered design process?</p><h5>Research</h5><p>We’re far from the first parents to struggle with the painful reality of stepping on little plastic knives. And like most parents, we’d learned threats and consequences were inadequate to the task of changing our kids’ behavior.</p><p>So we started with a current-state contextual analysis: The kid’s legos were kept in square canvas boxes in square Ikea bookcases in a room with a carpeted floor. Typically, the kids would pour the Legos out on the carpet — for the benefit of sorting through the small pieces while simultaneously incurring the pain-point that Legos are notoriously hard to clean up off the carpet.</p>    <a href='https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/1333ae93-6478-4bdd-994e-ead215ef83bb/legos.jpg' rel='nofollow'>            </a>                        <strong>For reals.</strong> If your product requires me to protect myself against it in my own home, the problem might be the product.

We knew the stakeholder perspective: We wanted the Legos to stay in their bins or — failing that — for the kids to pick them up after they were played with. But we didn’t assume we knew what the users wanted. So we talked to each of them in turn (no focus groups!) and what we found was eye opening. Of course, the kids didn’t want to pick up their Legos. It was inconvenient for play and difficult because of the carpet. But we were surprised to learn that the kids had also considered the Lego problem — they didn’t like discipline, after all — and they already had a solution in mind. If anything, like good users, they were frustrated we hadn’t asked sooner.</p><h5>Design</h5><p>Remember when I said, your user knows what they need?</p><p>One of our users asked us, “What about the train table with the big flat top and the large flat drawer underneath.”</p><p><em>Eureka.</em></p>    <a href='https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/302d95b7-6f03-429a-97c9-285098b76f34/toy-formats.jpg' rel='nofollow'>            </a>                        <strong>Repurposing affordances.</strong> What works for one interaction often works for another.

Or in the cubicle. Realizing your 40th really is your midlife might be the incentive you need for real change, knowing your kids will move out in a few years might help you re-prioritize, or seeing how much time you spent working on someone else’s dream might give you the motivation to start working for your own.</p><p>When I audited myself, I was shocked by how much time I’d spent at jobs that were poor fits for me. And at how little time I had left to do something else. I was also shocked to see how little time I had left with my kids at home, even as young as they are. Suddenly, the pain of sitting in traffic or spending an evening away at work took on new meaning. I didn’t resent my past — what’s done is done and there’s no way to change it — but I did let it color how I saw my present and my future.</p><h4>Usability Testing The Present: Eisenhower Charts</h4><p>Once you’ve looked back at your past, it’s time to look at how you’re spending your present.</p><p>An Eisenhower chart — cleverly named for the US president and general that saved the world — is a simple quadrant graph that juxtaposes urgency (typically, the Y-axis) with importance (typically the X-axis).

Because the humbling fact is, <em>no one else</em> is going to prioritize what’s important to you. Your loving partner, your supportive family, your boss and your clients — they all have their own priorities. They each have something that’s most important to them. And those priorities don’t necessarily align with yours.</p><p>Because the things that are important to each of us — not necessarily urgent — need time in our schedules if they’re going to provide us with genuine and lasting self-actualization. These are our priorities. And you know what you’re supposed to do with priorities.</p><p>Prioritize them.</p>    <a href='https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/991f38c4-9444-498c-8c5b-ffb1b26d500b/schedule-your-priorities.jpg' rel='nofollow'>            </a>                        <strong>Get sh!t done.</strong> “The key is not to prioritize your schedule but to schedule your priorities.” — <a href='https://www.stephencovey.com/7habits/7habits.php' rel='nofollow'>Stephen Covey, Seven Habits of Highly Effective People</a>.

Because, if you want to paint or travel or spend time with the kids or start a business, no one else is going to put that first. You have to. It is up to you to identify what’s important and then find time for it. And if time isn’t found for your priorities, you only have one person to blame.</p><p>We do these charts regularly, both for family and business planning. And one of the things I often take away from this exercise is the reminder to schedule blocks of time for the kids. And to schedule time for the thing I’m most passionate about — writing. I am a designer who writes but I aspire to become a writer who designs. And I’ll only get there if I prioritize it.</p><h4>Success Metrics For The Future: Affinity Mapping</h4><p>If you’ve ever seen a police procedural, you’ve seen an affinity map.</p><p>Affinity maps are a simple way to find patterns in qualitative data. UXers often use them to make sense of user interviews and survey data, to find patterns that inform personae or user requirements, and to tease out that most elusive <em>gap</em>.</p><p>In regards to designing your life, an affinity map is a powerful technique for individuals, partners, and teams to determine what they want and need out of their lives, to synthesize that information into actionable and measurable requirements, and to create a vision of what their life might look like in the future.</p>    <a href='https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/30bbb128-3fa4-4977-99e7-52daa9b6b2a2/affinity-map.jpg' rel='nofollow'>            </a>                        <strong>Great minds think alike.</strong> Team affinity mapping can help you and your family, or you and your business partners, align your priorities. My wife and I did this activity when we started our business to make sure we were on the same page. And we’ve looked back at it, regularly, to measure if we’re staying on target. (<a href='https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/30bbb128-3fa4-4977-99e7-52daa9b6b2a2/affinity-map.jpg' rel='nofollow'>Large preview</a>)            <p>You don’t need a template to get started affinity mapping. Just a lot of Post-It notes and a nice big wall, window, or table.</p><h6>How to affinity map your life (alone or with your life/business partners)</h6><ul><li>Write down any important goal you want to achieve on its own Post-it.</li><li>Write down important values or activities you want to prioritize on its own Post-it.</li><li>Categorize the insights under “I” statements to keep the analysis from the user’s (your!) point of view.</li><li>Organize that data by the insights it suggests. For instance, notes reading “I want to spend more time with my kids” and “I don’t want to commute for an hour each way” might fall under the heading “I want to work close to home.” </li><li>Timebox the exercise. You can easily spend all day on this one. Set a timer to make sure you don’t spend it overthinking (technical term: navel gazing).</li></ul><p>This is a shockingly quick and easy technique to synthesize the insights from Your Life In Weeks and your Eisenhower chart. And by framing the results in “I” statements, your aggregate research begins speaking back to you — as a pseudo personae of yourself or of your partnership with others.</p><p>Insights such as “I want to work close to home” and “I want to work with important causes” become your life’s requirements and the success metrics (KPIs). They’ll form the basis for testing and retrospectives.</p><p>Speaking of testing...</p><h4>Prototype Or Dive Right In</h4><p>Now that you’ve audited, validated, and created a vision for the life you want to live, what do you do with this information?</p><p>Design a solution!</p><p>Maybe you only need to change one thing. Maybe you need to change everything! Maybe you need to save up some runway money if the change impacts your income or your expenses. Maybe you need to dramatically cut your expenses. No change is without consequence, and your life’s requirements are different from anyone else’s.</p><p>When my wife sat down and did these activities, we determined we wanted to:</p><ul><li>Work together</li><li>Work from home, so we don’t have to commute</li><li>Start our work day early, so we’re done by the time the kids come home from school</li><li>Not check email or slack after hours or on weekends</li><li>Make time for our priorities and our passion projects.</li></ul>    <a href='https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/51c3b613-03cd-4e00-9470-b2f138b09fa7/services.png' rel='nofollow'>            </a>                        <strong>All about the pies.</strong> Aligning our priorities helped define the services or business offers and the delicious return on the investment our clients can expect.

And, in the process, these activities also helped us identify what services that business would offer. Design, content, education, and friendship became the verticals we wanted to give our time to and take fulfillment from.</p><p>But we didn’t just jump in, heedless or without regard to the impact a shift in employment and income might have on our family. Instead, we prototyped what this new business might look like before committing it to the market.</p>    <a href='https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/ca82ad37-4dee-4615-92d3-37d8c0fc0fcc/prototype.png' rel='nofollow'>            </a>                        <strong>Prototyping is serious business.</strong> We took advantage of a local hackathon to test working together and with a team before quitting our day jobs.

And because we prototyped, first, we had the confidence and a few clients in place so that we didn’t have to save too much money before making the change.</p><h4>The ROI For Designing Your Life</h4><p>Superficially, we designed a new business for ourselves. More deeply, though, we took control of variables and circumstances that let us meet our self-identified lifestyle goals: spending more time with the kids, prioritizing our marriage and our family above work, giving ourselves time to practice and grow our passions, and better control our financial futures.</p><p>The return on investment for designing your life is about as straightforward as design solutions get. As Bill Burnett and Dave Evans put it, “A well-designed life is a life that is generative — it is constantly creative, productive, changing, evolving, and there is always the possibility of surprise. You get out of it more than you put in.”</p><p>Hopefully you’ll see how a <em>Your Life In Weeks</em> audit can help you learn from your past, how an Eisenhower chart can help you prioritize the present, and how a simple affinity mapping exercise for your wants and needs can help you see beyond money-based decisions and assess if you’re making the right decisions regarding family, clients, and project.</p>    <a href='https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/7ebf5eab-17fa-48bf-a5e6-8dfd067b62d8/balance.png' rel='nofollow'>            </a>                        <strong>Live and work, by design.</strong> Mindfully designing our lives and our careers allowed us to pursue our own business (<a href='http://www.importantshit.co/' rel='nofollow'>J+E Creative</a>) and our separate passions (<a href='http://elliedecker.com/' rel='nofollow'>elliedecker.com</a> and <a href='http://o-jd.com' rel='nofollow'>o-jd.com</a>) (<a href='https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/7ebf5eab-17fa-48bf-a5e6-8dfd067b62d8/balance.png' rel='nofollow'>Large preview</a>)            <p>It’s always a give and a take. We frequently have to go back to our affinity map results to make sure we’re still on target. Or re-prioritize with an Eisenhower chart — especially in a challenging week. And, sometimes, the urgent trumps the important. It’s life, after all. But always with the understanding that we are each on the hook when our lives aren’t working out the way we want.

This involves building pages from scratch based on Illustrator or Sketch designs and making modifications to our WordPress sites. Lately we have been moving towards utilizing static site generators so interest and experience in those will be valued.<br /><br />Your HTML5 & CSS3 skills will shine as you show off optimization and code quality when resolving bugs and issues when they come up. You'll also work at designing and developing better user experiences and measuring the effect on those through A/B tests.<br /><br />We practice good coding standards, we build for the future, and we don't believe in cowboy coding or working in a bubble. We're looking for thinkers ... with talent. We don’t need employees.<br /><br />What you'll be doing day-to-day<br /><br />* Writing code with a focus on performance, speedy page load times, improving conversion rates<br />* Building sites and implementing redesigns, designed in Illustrator/Sketch, on our WordPress or static based sites<br />* Coding features for our sites (both through WP Themes and not) using HTML5/CSS/PHP/JS<br />* Designing and developing better user experiences and measuring the effect on those through A/B tests<br />* Future-proofing our sites with maintenance fixes, updating features, and rolling out responsive, mobile-friendly platforms<br />* Conversing, committing, and delivering via Asana/Slack/GitHub/email (in whatever order that is)<br />* Exploring new technologies/tools for finding solutions to new (and old) problems<br />* Optimizing conversions with A/B testing and Visual Website Optimizer and Google Optimize (yep ... important enough to list here and not with the Pluses below)<br />Application Architecture (things you'll HAVE to know)<br />* Experience with static site generators like Jekyll, Gatsby, or Hugo<br />* Fundamental PHP experience especially as it relates to maintaining WordPress themes and websites<br />* Semantic HTML<br />* Sass, Bourbon, etc. (or other CSS pre-processor)<br />* CSS Frameworks (Bourbon/Neat, Bootstrap, Foundation, etc... we roll our own, btw)<br />* JavaScript & jQuery skills<br />* Experience with build and package management tools like Gulp, Grunt, NPM, Bower, etc<br />* Structured Data (gotta satisfy the Googles)<br />* Advanced understanding of all the cool buzzwords...

We like to have a good time and minimize stress with good in-office coffee, lounge/reading time and regular happy hours. We work hard and meet realistic deadlines.

As the designer and technical lead, you will focus on one of our priority political areas, such as immigrant rights, criminal justice reform, or strengthening democratic representation. Working closely with a political director, you and your A-Team will build the web and mobile pieces of a campaign to pass strong policy on your issue or stop a disastrous bill from becoming law. Your role will be to explain complex issues—and get people to take effective political action—using design, copy, and code. We’re looking for someone with very strong visual and interaction design skills who can move from mockups to HTML/CSS, or design directly in code. Experience with modern front-end frameworks is a plus. &nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>You should be comfortable making and launching novel and creative additions to people’s online life with strong use of layout, color, and typography, whether for web, mobile, or social media.

Simple, progressive and gameful, we bring to life all the sound traditional financial principles we were brought up with (or wish we were!) and make managing money smart, fun &amp; relevant for the modern world.</p><p>We believe the world would be a better place if we all talked about money a little earlier on in life. Research shows that our money habits are formed by the age of seven. That’s a pretty amazing opportunity to help give kids a head-start in building habits that will stick with them for life.</p><p><br></p> <p><strong>WHY ROOSTERMONEY?</strong></p><p>We're well-funded with significant traction; hundreds of thousands of families have downloaded the RoosterMoney app since our launch in January 2016 and we have over 51 currencies being used by children around the world. RoosterMoney has been featured in The Times, Telegraph, Guardian, Wall Street Journal, New Zealand Herald to name a few. We’ve been on CNBC and are considered experts in our field.</p><p>We are now expanding across a number of markets and looking for a talented and motivated senior UI developer to join our team to help us raise our game and achieve even more amazing things. We have a generous share option scheme as we believe that everyone within the company should share in the success they help build.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>THE ROLE:</strong></p><p>We're looking for a software developer who has held senior positions on front-end engineering teams, who will operate with a high level of autonomy, ensuring impeccable reliability.

You have a passion for UX and UI, best practice development and building a product that delights users on a daily basis, taking pride in shipping quality code that is easy to test, maintain and build on. Aside from developing front-end applications, we expect you will also become involved with ops and back-end work with our Node API’s where required.</p><p>We are a small team so it’s important that the successful candidate isn’t just technically highly competent but is a good cultural fit. We run daily stand-ups, two week sprint cycles, retrospectives and utilise Slack for Chat and Jira for ticket and stream management. We use video calls to stay in contact and monthly all team meetings (State of the Rooster). We gather together every quarter for All Hands to celebrate successes, share ideas and plan for the next quarter of hustle.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Apply if you want to:</strong></p><ul> <li>Work closely with a small group of determined, like-minded people to reshape the way families talk and engage with money around the world.</li> <li>Play a critical role in the design and development of our app.</li> <li>Ship and take ownership of impactful new features and functionality.</li> <li>Develop robust deployment and testing processes </li> <li>Share your knowledge and passion with the rest of the team in making the app best in class.</li> </ul><br><p><strong>Benefits</strong></p><br><p><strong>In addition to a competitive salary:<br> </strong></p><ul> <li>Work with a fun, passionate team building something awesome.</li> <li>25 days holiday</li> <li>Pension Scheme</li> <li>Employee Option Scheme so you can benefit for all the input you put into the company.</li> <li>We will consider remote working for this role so long as you can spend up to 20% of your time in our London Bridge Hub office.

The phrase that most aptly describes us is “boutique consulting firm” as we are currently working on select software consulting projects while concurrently laying the foundation for a stand-alone product which will focus on enabling business workflows and growing workplace productivity. We are being smart in our approach balancing software consulting with our own product. We balance both to pay ourselves well and support our vision for the future. We have an excellent four person team in place with Big-4 backend experience. We're looking to get one final person in place to help us define what a modern and maintainable front-end stack should look like and to help build our product. Hopefully that's you.</p><p>Who you are: An incredibly motivated, amazingly talented full stack engineer whose abilities truly shine on the front end. You know React, Webpack, CSS, Sass, JSX, and the other standard front-end technologies we aren't as familiar with. You are a self-starter who can work with little supervision. You are meticulous about details and sufficiently passionate to get things done, yet know when to pivot to a more experimental move-fast mode. You should be a great teammate who looks to make your colleagues more productive because you know they are doing the same for you. You love the state-of-the-art and yet understand the danger of being there and can articulate the reasons why.</p><p><a href='https://www.builtforme.tech' rel='nofollow'>https://www.builtforme.tech</a></p><p><a href='https://blog.builtforme.tech' rel='nofollow'>https://blog.builtforme.tech</a></p><p>Apply via AngelList: <a href='https://angel.co/builtforme/jobs/' rel='nofollow'>https://angel.co/builtforme/jobs/</a><span>              </span></p><div>        <p>                      <u></u>                        </p></div></span></div>"

They were spending days sending out RFQs, waiting for feedback, sending drawings, asking for different quantities, waiting for more feedback, only to receive back less than optimal pricing and lead times. We also knew that designers were not always fully aware of the capabilities and limitations of the latest manufacturing technology advances.</p><p>Second, we heard frustration from machine shops, who were spending a lot of time and energy responding to inquiries for custom parts that ultimately did not happen. In addition, without extensive sales and marketing resources, many of these shops were limited to working with customers in their local area, making it difficult to grow their business.</p><p>At Xometry, we created a proprietary software platform to enable product designers and engineers to instantly access the capacity of a nationwide network of manufacturing facilities. Our platform makes it possible for customers to receive instant pricing, expected lead times and manufacturability feedback. At the push of a button, the network is able to deliver high quality parts at consistently fast lead times while offering very low prices.</p><p>We make it easy for all customers — from startups to Fortune 100 companies — to access manufacturing on demand by providing the most efficient way to source high-quality custom parts. We’re dedicated to keeping more manufacturing in America by providing an innovative way for customers to easily work with facilities across the country.</p>            </div>                            <h2>Benefits</h2>                    <ul>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Health Insurance</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Vacation Time</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Snacks</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Stock Otions</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Dental</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Vision</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Happy hours and team events</span>                            </li>                    </ul>                "

The experiences they publish work consistently across all browsers and devices, and all customer engagement is tracked with extensive analytics. All without writing code.</span></p><p><strong>About the Product</strong></p><p><span>Designing and building the Ceros platform is not an easy task. We require the best-of-the-best web developers, designers, and QA testers, ready to bring the functionality of desktop software to the web, often pushing web browsers to the limits of what’s currently possible.</span></p><p><span>Our codebase is 95% JavaScript and the Ceros product is comprised of multiple single-page applications with a client-heavy focus. We use libraries like jQuery, Require, and Backbone. The Ceros Studio is architected around the HTML5 Canvas element.</span></p><p><span>We’re not language zealots. We believe in using the right tool for the job, and our current server-side infrastructure runs PHP, Node.js, Redis, AWS Aurora, Chef, etc. on the Amazon AWS cloud.</span></p><p><strong>About the Team</strong></p><p><span>As part of the Ceros product team, you’ll be working with a small, cross-functional group of the most talented people you’ve ever worked with. We hire only passionate and creative people with a proven and unquestionable ability to execute, and every member of the team is equally responsible for moving the product forward.</span></p><p><span>We have a dynamic company culture that collaborates daily. We care deeply about the user experience, and we debate passionately about our ideas. When you work at Ceros, you check your ego at the door, and you aren’t afraid to be honest, especially to yourself. We take our jobs seriously but ourselves not so much -- whether it’s cracking jokes in the chat room or poking fun at the CEO’s atrocious spelling.</span></p><p><strong>About the Job</strong></p><p><span>Working completely from home, you’ll be communicating often through chat rooms, email, and video conferencing. We offer flexible working hours and an extremely flexible vacation policy. And we provide excellent gear (15” Macbook Pro, iPad, external monitor, etc.).</span></p><p><span>We believe that every piece of content created within Ceros is an experience. As such, we strive for the user’s experience to be as smooth as possible. To achieve this, we need developers with a passion for web performance. We’re looking for people with experience profiling javascript applications and squeezing every last millisecond out of the code. We want somebody that is knowledgeable in web performance best practices and strives to make code faster.</span></p><p><span>Desired experience:</span></p><ul><li><span>Object-oriented programming</span></li><li><span>Image &amp; video asset optimization (Webp, Adaptive bitrate streaming, etc.)</span></li><li><span>Asset preloading </span></li><li><span>Efficient use of caches</span></li><li><span>Building performant web animations</span></li><li><span>HTTP/2 protocol to streamline loading</span></li><li><span>Impress us with anything else you have experience with!</span></li></ul><p><span>As a developer, your typical day-to-day involves:</span></p><ul><li><span>writing maintainable code (probably goes without saying),</span></li><li><span>having your day ruined by functional QA testers who find every bug you write,</span></li><li><span>carrying out and being on the receiving end of intense code review sessions from your peers who hold your work (and their own) at the highest of standards,</span></li><li><span>agonizing over the user experience until even a trained monkey could use the product,</span></li><li><span>collaborating with and mentoring your peers on security best practices,</span></li><li><span>and finally, deploying your code to production and seeing the customer create something amazing and beautiful with it.</span></li></ul><p><strong>Next Steps</strong></p><p><span>If you’re interested in being part of the Ceros team, please send your resume and a cover letter to us. We’re a company of passionate, honest, and sometimes silly people, so don’t be afraid to express yourself.</span></p>                </div>                                    <div>                                    <div>                                        <div>        <a href='https://stackoverflow.com/jobs/apply/186544?reset=False&amp;ra=10yMLam10e64&amp;oqs=a%3D10yMLam10e64' rel='nofollow'>Apply now</a></div>                                    </div>                        </div>        </div>            <h2>About Ceros</h2>            <div><p>With flexible hours, a generous vacation policy and the best darn coworkers you could ask for, we don't need to resort to bribing new hires with candy from our creepy white van.</p>            </div>                            <h2>Benefits</h2>                    <ul>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Flexible Vacation Policy</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Health Insurance</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Enjoy Your Work</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Flexible Hours</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Top-notch Gear</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Stock Options</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Work 100% From Home</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Team meet-ups 3x/year</span>                            </li>                    </ul>                "

Check us out at <a href='https://springshare.com' rel='nofollow'>https://springshare.com</a>. We’ve been around since 2007. Our target market is small so we’ll never go public and we won’t promise you equity worth millions on paper. Come and help us grow – slow but steady. In return we offer a great and supportive small team environment where your work will definitely have a big impact, competitive salary and full benefits, a steady job, and that great feeling that your work matters because it is improving the worlds’ libraries and schools (we are international, with client institutions in 80 countries).</p><p>We’re looking for a full stack intermediate/senior software engineer. Our tech stack is LNMP and Angular so you must have 5+ years of professional experience with current knowledge of PHP or Angular, or both. Experience in OOP/MVC concepts is a must, too.</p><p>We’re also looking for a product manager with 3+ years of PM experience, to manage one or two products with each product having 2-3 developers working on it. PM is not purely technical position but working knowledge of concepts of web technologies is required.  We’re agile/scrum shop.</p><p>You must be comfortable – and highly productive – working remotely. We do have an office in NYC but everyone else works remotely. We’d prefer if you live in one of these states - NY, CA, FL, PA, MA, or KY. If you’re international, the working hours must overlap significantly with US working hours.</p><p>Send us your resume at jobs@springshare.com or contact me personally (I’m the founder/owner) at slaven@<span>              </span></p><div>        <p>                      <u></u>                        </p></div></span></div>"

We have over two million registered users from around the world. Our primary product is an online, real time collaborative editor for papers, theses, technical reports and other documents written in the LaTeX markup language.</div><div><br></div><div><strong>Who We Are</strong></div><div><br></div><div>Overleaf was founded by two mathematicians who were inspired by their own experiences in academia to create a better solution for scientific collaboration and communication. Now we are a team of thirty with about a dozen developers, based mainly in and around the UK and in the US.</div><div><br></div><div>About half of our development team joined us through our acquisition of ShareLaTeX, another major online LaTeX editor, last summer, and we've now integrated the two teams.</div><div><br></div><div><strong>Our Tech</strong></div><div><br></div><div>Overleaf is based on open source software, and following our integration with ShareLaTeX, around 80% of our product code is itself open source. You can find it on GitHub:&nbsp;<a href='https://workable.com/nr?l=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fsharelatex%2Fsharelatex' rel='nofollow'>https://github.com/sharelatex/sharelatex</a></div><div><br></div><div>We currently have two overlapping tech stacks, one from Overleaf and one from ShareLaTeX. We are working on merging them together into &quot;Overleaf v2&quot;, which is now in public beta ( https://www.overleaf.com/help/342 ) and will launch in time for the fall academic term in September 2018.</div><div><br></div><div>Overleaf v1 has a Ruby on Rails backend using PostgreSQL and redis, hosted mainly on Heroku. We also have several node.js services that we've extracted from our rails monolith. On the frontend, recent development has been with React in ES6, bundled with webpack.</div><div><br></div><div>Overleaf v2 and ShareLaTeX run on a node.js backend using MongoDB and redis, hosted mainly on Linode and managed with Chef. Here we use a microservice architecture, with about a dozen services. Mainly our code is written in CoffeeScript, but new code is being written in ES6 where possible. On the frontend, we mainly use Angular v1, with some newer components being written with React.</div><div><br></div><div>We use Docker to manage our development environments, and our devops team is currently working on moving our production infrastructure to Kubernetes. We support continuous delivery and typically deploy at least a few times a day (less on Fridays).</div><div><br></div><div><strong>How We Work</strong></div><div><br></div><div>Overleaf is remote-first — all founders and staff work remotely. We also have an office by King's Cross station for those in the London area, and we get the whole team together in London several times a year for face-to-face time.</div><div><br></div><div>We encourage flexible working. Our core hours are 2pm–5pm UK time, during which we have a 10–15 minute daily standup call for the whole development team. We have few standing meetings for developers, but we do many smaller video or voice calls for pairing or within project groups.</div><div><br></div><div>We don't yet have standing teams, but we form and dissolve smaller teams on a per-project basis; we try to give everyone the opportunity to serve as a team lead if they want to.</div><div><br></div><div>We always collect user feedback to inform our work. We have UX professionals on our team, and we run many surveys and user interviews.</div><div><br></div><div>We organize our work with Kanban. We use GitHub pull requests for each feature with code review to share knowledge and best practices (and catch bugs). We test thoroughly with automated unit and acceptance tests, supported by continuous integration (CI). We're also fans of linting to minimise bike-shedding (and to catch bugs).</div><div><br></div><div><strong>About This Role</strong></div><div><br></div><div>We plan to add up to three developers to our team, two with a backend focus and one with a frontend focus. Full stack developers are also very welcome to apply.</div><div><br></div><div>This year, you will work mainly on our integration projects — building out Overleaf v2. Here are some examples of projects (large and small) we've recently completed, to give you an idea of what you might work on:</div><div><br></div><ul><li><a href='https://workable.com/nr?l=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.overleaf.com%2Fblog%2F644-two-quick-updates-to-overleaf-v2-based-on-your-feedback' rel='nofollow'>https://www.overleaf.com/blog/644-two-quick-update...</a></li><li><a href='https://workable.com/nr?l=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sharelatex.com%2Fblog%2F2017%2F11%2F27%2Fintegration-update-link-sharing.html' rel='nofollow'>https://www.sharelatex.com/blog/2017/11/27/integra...</a></li><li><a href='https://workable.com/nr?l=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.overleaf.com%2Fblog%2F523-a-data-driven-approach-to-latex-autocomplete' rel='nofollow'>https://www.overleaf.com/blog/523-a-data-driven-ap...</a></li></ul><div><a href='https://workable.com/nr?l=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.overleaf.com%2Fblog%2F523-a-data-driven-approach-to-latex-autocomplete' rel='nofollow'></a></div><div><br></div><div>Post-integration, we are planning projects around improved collaboration features for teams, improvements to our rich text mode, and more.</div><div><br></div><div><strong>How We Hire</strong></div><div><br></div><div>The stages in our hiring process are typically:</div><div><br></div><ol><li>We will aim to update you on the status of your application within one week from when we receive it.</li><li>We'll schedule a short video or voice call to discuss your application. This is a non-technical screening call, up to 30 minutes long, in which we get to know each other and assess whether there may be a good fit. In particular, we'll discuss logistics and your ambitions and expectations, and we may ask for clarifications on your application. This is also an opportunity for you to ask questions.</li><li>We'll schedule a more in-depth interview, which is typically two hours long. The first hour is discussion, and the second hour is technical. For the technical, you'll have the option of either completing a homework assignment, which requires about one hour of your time before the interview, or solving a problem in the interview, if you prefer. The problems are practical in nature (no fizz-buzz or reversing linked lists), and you can use Google, man pages, etc., and ask us questions.</li><li>We'll make an offer. We usually interview in batches, so there may be a short delay while we interview other candidates, but we will try to keep you informed throughout the process.</li></ol><div>If you have a deadline, please let us know in your application, and we will try to be accommodating.</div><div><br></div><div><b><span>Requirements</span><br></b></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div><span><br></span></div><div>We require that you:</div><div><br></div><ul><li>have a minimum of 2–3 years of relevant experience (we aren't taking on more new graduates at the moment).<br></li><li>will work for us full time (or nearly full time).<br></li><li>will usually be available in our core hours, 2pm–5pm UK time.</li></ul><div><br></div><div>Experience with the technologies we use is always a bonus, but you don't need to know them all; your ability to learn is much more important to us.</div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span><b>Benefits</b></span></div><div><br></div><ul><li>Remote and flexible working.<br></li><li>Salary £40k<span>–</span>£75k per year depending on experience.<br></li><li>You would join a small, dedicated and growing team.<br></li><li>We're substantially (around 80%) open source, so your work will often be on open source code.<br></li><li>We're backed by Bethnal Green Ventures ( https://bethnalgreenventures.com/ ) and Digital Science ( https://www.digital-science.com/ ), through which we're part of a wider community of startups in science, health and ed-tech.<br></li><li>Our London office is shared with several other Digital Science companies, so there's lots of interesting people to meet, and clubs and sports activities outside of work.<br></li><li>You can pick your own equipment. MacBook Pro? Lenovo ThinkPad? Notebook and pen? However you like to work, we'll provide what you need.<br></li><li>We provide a training budget; many of our developers choose to attend relevant industry conferences or buy training materials.<br></li><li>We run a biweekly internal seminar series (show and tell) with short talks from staff about their work or personal projects, new technologies and techniques.</li></ul><div><br></div><div>We are an equal opportunity employer and value diversity at our company. We do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, color, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, age, marital status, veteran status, or disability status.</div>  </div>  <div>    <h4>Apply for this position</h4>    <p>Please send us a resume and covering letter via <a href='https://overleaf.workable.com/jobs/734449/candidates/new' rel='nofollow'>https://overleaf.workable.com/jobs/734449/candidates/new</a> . </p>  </div>"

We believe time is valuable and you should be able to make the most of it. We focused on simplicity, security and scalability, to create an innovative service accessible to everyone.<br /><br />We’ve been rapidly growing over the last year and recently closed a $1.1m funding round (it’s £850k, but $1.1m sounds so much cooler doesn’t it) to fuel our global expansion. <br /><br />We’re a young team who strongly believes in making your work a positive part of your life, creating a flexible working environment and making an impact through what we do. People you know will be using our product and we take pride in offering them a good service. <br /><br />About the role:<br /><br />As a lead developer at Stasher you'll be involved in building systems that support new client-facing features as well as working to improve our internal tools and systems. Your day might range from working on our core API, to planning a new host dashboard and managing junior engineers based remotely.<br /><br />We're looking for someone with a strong overall development background to help act as the bridge between business and tech and to make architectural decisions. This means you'll have a lot of responsibility and autonomy. You should have experience with, and a love for, building scalable back end systems and beautiful front end ones. Ideally you'll have actually built a few in your time.

Gross and Edward Druce of Course Concierge.</p><p>Course Concierge is an online course publishing company that creates industry-leading online courses for NYT best-selling authors, TED speakers and YouTubers with millions of subscribers.</p><p>Our clients include YouTubers with 100,000,000+ views, one of the most hotly-followed health experts on Instagram, and a coach to NFL athletes, NBA players and U.S. special forces.</p><p>We’ve run over a dozen launches the past year alone, and we’re doing very well.</p><p>Check us out here: <a href='https://courseconcierge.com' rel='nofollow'>http://courseconcierge.com</a></p><p>For the right person, this is a Dream Opportunity — and dream company.</p><p>We’re one-year-old and growing, and we’re looking for a second developer to join our team of 12.</p><p><strong>If you are someone who…</strong></p><p>- Wants to excel in your career and take pride in active and stimulating work</p><p>- Is looking for a shot to prove yourself</p><p>- Gets excited at the prospect of learning a tremendous amount, with fast-paced and varied demands</p><p>- Has the ability to work within tight deadlines and juggle multiple tasks with poise</p><p>…this could be the opportunity you’ve been looking for.</p><p><strong>We’re a great company to join. Here’s why…</strong></p><p>- We’re young (just a year old) and you will be getting in at the ground level</p><p>- We have an unbelievably engaged team, with world-class people in every department (from video production to research to copywriting and design)</p><p>- Our clients are fantastic. We only take on a handful and are incredibly selective in who we work with</p><p>- We’re a remote company and you’ve the freedom to work from anywhere in the US.</p><p>- We’re going places.</p><p><strong>This position is the right fit for you if…</strong></p><p>- You are someone who completely understands how WordPress works at the code level. You have built your own custom themes/plugins and you know how to extend WordPress core.</p><p>- You understand how REST APIs work and you are comfortable consuming RESTful web services, either via the client (AJAX) or the server (PHP).</p><p>- You like finding smart and elegant solutions to coding problems, in line with WordPress coding and security best practices. Your code is clean, understandable &nbsp;and well commented.</p><p>- You have solid knowledge of PHP, MySQL, HTML, Javascript/JQuery, CSS. Experience on any kind of front-end framework (i.e. Bootstrap) or Javascript framework (React, Vue) is a plus.</p><p>- You are competent with version control systems (Git) and having experience with modern web development workflows and tools (Yarn, Gulp, Sass) is a plus.</p><p><strong>You need to…</strong></p><p>- Like a big workload and be comfortable working quickly. We like to get a lot done in a day and you will be pushed</p><p>- Welcome revisions and embrace our perfectionist tendencies (as well as our clients’)</p><p>- Help us refine our technical processes</p><p>- Be a clear and capable communicator. As a company we take writing seriously. Great English and attention to detail are essential.</p><p>- Be someone we love working with! Fit comes first, above everything else for us. If you don’t ‘spark joy’ for the team, no matter how good you are, we won’t take you.</p><p>Nearly all of our communication is written (we use Basecamp 3 and are big fans of it), but we’d like you to be comfortable getting on the occasional call too.</p><p><strong>You will be needed for the following…</strong></p><p>Throughout each project, we have five core needs for development.</p><p><strong>1. Lay the foundation</strong></p><p>Setup of a client’s domain and hosting, and integration of a payment gateway, membership plugin, affiliate plugin and email platform.</p><p>As a team, we consider ourselves ‘mixed online course artists’.</p><p>Most clients already have websites, hosting and email platforms. Whatever platforms they’re using, we need to be able to get on with them and have them work well together (minimising migrations as much as possible).</p><p>The one exception to this is we do everything on WordPress.</p><p><strong>2. Create a stunning email capture page</strong></p><p>Here are two examples from some of our clients…</p><p><a href='https://theweekendwoodworker.com/' rel='nofollow'>https://theweekendwoodworker.com/</a></p><p><a href='https://artofcoaching.com/' rel='nofollow'>https://artofcoaching.com/</a></p><p>From our design team’s PSDs, everything you create needs to be wonderfully responsive, and no stone (from the thank you page to a nicely formatted confirmation email) left unturned.</p><p><strong>3. Build a long-form sales page</strong></p><p>Our designers make sales pages that are many thousands of words digestible and enticing to read. We need you to do their work justice.</p><p><strong>4. Creation of membership area</strong></p><p>Pick a favourite WordPress membership plugin and create a layout that houses a course with clear and simple navigation.</p><p>We always look to enhance the user experience for clients’ customers and deliver the best learning environment possible.</p><p><strong>5. </strong><strong>Checkout</strong><strong> page</strong></p><p>Making sure payments are taken, membership entitlements are correct and segments are created in a newsletter platform for buyers.</p><p>You know where we can get free SSLs and best practices for security.</p><p>*</p><p>The position will start at 20-25 hours per week, with a view to becoming near enough full-time in a matter of months. Pay will be set at a competitive hourly rate, fixed.</p><p><strong>To apply…</strong></p><p>Please write to kathryn@courseconcierge.com&nbsp;with ONE example of a responsive page you have coded, along with a brief pitch on why you think you’d be a great fit.</p><p>Do not send more than one link or your entry will be disqualified.&nbsp;</p><p>Also, please do not send a resume, CV or attachment of any kind. We don’t care where you went to college (or that you even went at all) — all that matters is whether you can do it.</p><p>We won’t be able to get back to everyone, but for those who stand out, we will send a list of interview questions in writing, then, for the few we like best, set up a brief call to discuss the opportunity.</p><p>The deadline for submissions is June 10, though those who apply sooner have an advantage.</p><p>We will pick two candidates from interviews to begin a paid two-week trial (to assess on-the-job performance and cultural fit). One person will then be chosen for the ongoing role.</p><p>Thank you for reading. Best of luck, and I look forward to hearing from you!</p><p>Kathryn</p>"

There are some GitHub PRs you need to review, so you head there first. The rest of the morning goes by working on that feature for the weekly client demo tomorrow. Lunchtime arrives so you head to your Yoga class. Feeling stretched and relaxed, you make yourself something to eat, grab (another) cup of coffee and get back to work. Some remote problem solving with the team and then it’s back to code. Hunger calls (where did the day go) and you know it’s time to shut the laptop.

You'll never spend more than a few days on the same project - o</span>ne day you may implement a homepage redesign and the next, you'll entirely re-write a client's checkout flow.

You’ll be an integral part of our product and engineering teams focused on architecting and developing our client-side programming.</p><p>We’re looking for a strong track record of architecting and building products. With that said, we’re not looking for a 100% match on experience or our stack. If you have a history of shipping solid work, we’re interested.</p><p>*What You'll Do*<br>* Lead development on the client layer and user experience.<br>* Develop a comprehensive HTML/CSS/JS framework for rendering web applications for multiple devices and themes.<br>* Refine the application building experience that makes it a delight for our customers to use and extend Knack.<br>* Consistently improve the speed, reliability, and performance of the Knack client application.<br>* Evaluate new technologies and help determine opportunities to leverage these.<br>* Work on implementing front-end Knack features.</p><p>How you’ll do this:<br>* Program: ship code every day<br>* Contribute: we want our engineers to make an impact on the Knack product. This means you're not just implementing features that have been specified to death. It includes developing ideas, making suggestions, and keeping on top of new tech to understand opportunities.<br>* Engage: we have enough areas of need where we want to leverage what you're excited about and use that to make Knack a better product.<br>* Learn and grow: we do code-reviews, pair-programming, lunch-and-learns, and actively engage in chat to constantly teach and learn.</p><p>You won’t have a direct boss but will be working collaboratively with our small engineering team of 10, and with cross-functional teams on specific projects.</p><p>Our work is 100% remote. We use Slack, Trello, Google Docs and Google Hangouts to get our work done.</p><p>*About You*<br>Above all, you build things. You have a history of starting --and completing-- projects, whether that’s products, applications, games, libraries, or plugins.</p><p>You’re both a teacher and a learner. You’re not afraid to admit when someone may know more than you. You have the confidence to help others level up.</p><p>You’re an outstanding communicator. You can document a problem, and clearly and succinctly outline a solution. You’re not afraid to distill things into plain English for teammates and customers.</p><p>You have experience working in fast-paced environments, prioritizing and balancing multiple projects, and working with cross-functional teams.</p><p>You want to work on a product you can be proud of that impacts thousands of people all over the world, from non-profits to the world’s biggest companies.</p><p>You go all in.

We’re now ready to take things to the next level and maximize the opportunity for what this product can be.</p><p>So why are we different?</p><p>We’re bootstrapped: we’ve had to build something our customers actually pay for. This changes how you do things.</p><p>We’re 100% remote: and have been from the beginning. Every decision we’ve made has been based around optimizing our remote operations.</p><p>We’re small: and we like it that way. We’re more than just chat avatars-- we’ve all gotten to know each other, have grown together, and love working with each other.</p><p>We enjoy the journey: we’re in this for the long haul. We’re not chasing an exit or the next round of funding. We’re building something we’re proud of and want to keep improving on.</p><p>*Benefits &amp; Compensation*<br>Competitive salaries and generous equity: rather than give up equity to investors to pay engineering salaries, we’ve chosen to give more of that equity to our team while still paying strong salaries.</p><p>Define your work: our only rule is our overlap zone of 11am to 4pm EST. Otherwise find the location, environment, and schedule that is best for your life and work. It’s not about separation, it’s about optimization.</p><p>Unlimited Paid Vacation: take the time you need to stay motivated, charged, and balanced. You’ll get forced days off for birthdays and knackiversaries.</p><p>Paid Corporate Retreats: we get together twice a year at amazing locations to do normal human being things in person. We pay for your flight, lodging, and meals.</p><p>Learning Credits: an annual allowance is provided to stay on top of your game with classes, books, and conferences.</p><p>HealthCare: we offer health, vision, and dental, covering 75% of the premium for you and your dependents (spouse + children).</p><p>Please note that we are only considering applicants legally eligible to work in the US.</p></div>"

We are at a stage where our interest lies in finding founding team members. We will happily expose you to strategy, planning and the entire foundation of the business if and when required.</p><p>The right person is not afraid to shake things up or speak up when needed. They will stand their ground when they know they are right, and learn from it when they are wrong. </p><p>Technical skills are important, but making sure everyone in the team gets along is even more. We work in a distributed environment, so working alone, using technology for discussions and managing your own time are added challenges you will have to deal with.</p><p>Now, we also realise that these kind of people don’t just turn up out of the blue. So we are always on the lookout and are planning to grow based on people, not hire based on growth. In return, you must be committed, and anything measured in months will be considered insufficient.</p><p>Finally; if your only goal in life is to make a difference and genuinely help wineries, you really should get in touch. Otherwise, if this sounds like a means to an end, you can simply head over here: <a href='https://w.troly.io/u3is8' rel='nofollow'>https://w.troly.io/u3is8</a></p></div>"

But lawyers are terribly served by traditional recruitment agencies, who rely on anonymised web ads or inexperienced cold callers to engage potential legal recruits.<br /><br />Our founders, Tom Balmer and David Crocker, have been involved in the establishment and growth of some of the best names in the legal recruitment industry since the early noughties.  In 2017 they launched Third Way Legal, a marketplace platform designed to change the way lawyers engage with the jobs market.<br /><br />Third Way is a unique network, where lawyers can confidentially see which firms are looking for lawyers like them (in some ways it is similar to workinginstartups.com!). Following an amazing first year, where we have grown to 6 people and are annualising a million in turnover, we now are looking to build an in-house tech team.<br /><br />It's an extremely exciting time to join the business.  We are expanding into the interim market, looking to grow into new geographies, and have so many new feature ideas it hurts.  We're looking for a full-stack developer, comfortable with front and back end development, who is pragmatic and can eager to grow with the firm.  If that sounds like you, and you'd like to join us on our journey to change the legal recruitment industry, please get in touch!"

You’ll be faced with a huge variety of tasks and you’ll constantly have to learn new things as you go. You might be writing database queries one day, designing a user interface the next day, answering customer service emails the day after that, and putting together an investor pitch deck in between. You’ll develop skills that will be useful for the rest of your career and you’ll learn to deal with pressure, stress, and risk. You’ll be pushed beyond your comfort zone, which is where learning really happens. This is why many people learn more in three months at a startup than three years at a big company.<br> In a startup, all you have is a bunch of guesses about what might work in the market, and the focus is on search. It turns out that searching is a lot more fun.<br>Even the “crappy” days at a startup can be fun. The ghetto office, the need to scrape by on a budget, the constant sense that you have no idea what you’re doing can all be terrifying, but also exciting. They teach you to appreciate the small victories in life rather than becoming obsessed with promotions or politics.</p></div>"

Think of the Union platform as a way for folks running programs like 500 Startups (they run on Union) or startup challenges at organizations like Comcast or the DoD (they also run on Union) to organize themselves, between calendaring, discussion management, learning tools, and event management.</p><p><i></i>Our stack and processes:<i></i> Union is Rails, React, Redis, Postgres, Elasticsearch. We run on AWS, and our operations are powered by Ansible. We use scrum because it provides just enough process to make us productive, but we try to avoid some of the major pitfalls by letting our whole team chime in on the process. We do continuous integration and delivery.</p><p><i></i>Our team:<i></i> We are a small, lean team and you would play a big part on how we work. We have some very experienced folks on the team but our minds aren’t set in stone. Help us define how to make you work at your best. Our organization is diverse, and we’re at about a 50/50 split between men and women org-wide.</p><p><i></i>Remote friendly:<i></i> We have parts of our org in DC, Portugal and Dubai. We’re open to people from anywhere but would love not to stretch our timezone span too much.

Our team may be small, but NoRedInk is used by 1 in 2 school districts in the US, and students have answered over 2 billion questions on our platform.</p><p>We’re a group of friendly people who listen to and learn from each other. We discuss past mistakes openly so we can adapt our processes to the challenges that come with progress. Puns flow freely across our San Francisco office as well as on Slack, and we have remote engineers spanning six different time zones.</p><p>Our engineering team [1] prides itself on code quality and innovation. We use the cutting-edge Elm programming language for all our new front-end code, and have been migrating legacy React code to Elm as well. Our back-end is primarily Ruby on Rails, although we are working to split off smaller services as we scale to keep up with our traffic. You can read about our experiences with these technologies on our team blog! [2]</p><p>In addition to spending work hours open-sourcing useful libraries we develop [3], we also invest financially in open source. We hired the creator of Elm, Evan Czaplicki, to develop Elm full time. [4] Evan discusses his plans for the language with the team every week, periodically pairs with other engineers on Elm, and cracks up members of the sales team with his lunchtime jokes.</p><p>We use Amazon AWS for our infrastructure and automate all of our deployments using Chef and OpsWorks. We write a lot of tests, and use Jenkins for continuous integration. Our process for new features begins with our product team and in-house visual designer, continues with a GitHub pull request from a feature branch into master, and ends with our in-house QA specialist trying to break it before it reaches production.</p><p>We’re looking for engineers who want to work on a mission that makes a difference and who are the type of collaborators that value kindness and open-mindedness, over convincing the group they’re right.</p><p>You can learn more about what to expect through blog posts about our interview process [5] and on-boarding experience [6].</p><p>If you’re interested, please apply through our jobs page! <a href='https://www.noredink.com/jobs' rel='nofollow'>https://www.noredink.com/jobs</a></p><p>[1] <a href='https://www.noredink.com/about/team' rel='nofollow'>https://www.noredink.com/about/team</a></p><p>[2] <a href='http://tech.noredink.com/' rel='nofollow'>http://tech.noredink.com/</a></p><p>[3] <a href='https://github.com/NoRedInk/' rel='nofollow'>https://github.com/NoRedInk/</a></p><p>[4] <a href='http://tech.noredink.com/post/136615783598/welcome-evan' rel='nofollow'>http://tech.noredink.com/post/136615783598/welcome-evan</a></p><p>[5] <a href='http://tech.noredink.com/post/145260396603/our-engineering-hiring-process' rel='nofollow'>http://tech.noredink.com/post/145260396603/our-engineering-h...</a></p><p>[6] <a href='http://tech.noredink.com/post/143787279069/on-boarding-as-a-new-remote-engineer-think-about' rel='nofollow'>http://tech.noredink.com/post/143787279069/on-boarding-as-a-...</a><span>              </span></p><div>        <p>                      <u></u>                        </p></div></span></div>"

The phrase that most aptly describes us is “boutique consulting firm” as we are currently working on select software consulting projects while concurrently laying the foundation for a stand-alone product which will focus on enabling business workflows and growing workplace productivity. We are being smart in our approach balancing software consulting with our own product. We balance both to pay ourselves well and support our vision for the future. We have an excellent four person team in place with Big-4 backend experience. We're looking to get one final person in place to help us define what a modern and maintainable front-end stack should look like and to help build our product. Hopefully that's you.</p><p>Who you are: An incredibly motivated, amazingly talented full stack engineer whose abilities truly shine on the front end. You know React, Webpack, CSS, Sass, JSX, and the other standard front-end technologies we aren't as familiar with. You are a self-starter who can work with little supervision. You are meticulous about details and sufficiently passionate to get things done, yet know when to pivot to a more experimental move-fast mode. You should be a great teammate who looks to make your colleagues more productive because you know they are doing the same for you. You love the state-of-the-art and yet understand the danger of being there and can articulate the reasons why.</p><p><a href='https://www.builtforme.tech' rel='nofollow'>https://www.builtforme.tech</a></p><p><a href='https://blog.builtforme.tech' rel='nofollow'>https://blog.builtforme.tech</a></p><p>Apply via AngelList: <a href='https://angel.co/builtforme/jobs/' rel='nofollow'>https://angel.co/builtforme/jobs/</a><span>              </span></p><div>        <p>                      <u></u>                        </p></div></span></div>"

Our vision is to become the backbone for scientific communication by building the infrastructure to enable a seamless flow of academic journal articles. We are making millions of scientific journal articles available with one-click, saving 10 million researchers time and frustration when accessing scientific knowledge. We are proud to get our hands dirty to develop the core infrastructure that lets scientists shine. <br /> <br />Job description <br /><br />We are looking for a front-end engineer to join our small and highly talented team to work on our browser extension. You’ll be adding new features, improving reliability and performance of the Kopernio extension and improving the overall user experience as we grow Kopernio to millions of users. You will be working alongside product and UX, and directly with our founders, and you will play a central role in defining the future of our product and the technologies we use.  As a front-end engineer you should always work with a strong focus on end-users and build Kopernio to enable them to do their research. <br /> <br />Your primary responsibility will be the development of the Kopernio browser extension, ensuring that researchers can get seamless access to journal article across hundreds of different online platforms. <br /> <br />About you <br /><br />● You have proven expertise developing, releasing and maintaining complex Javascript (ES6) applications <br />● Ideally you have built cross-browser applications using the Web Extensions framework <br />● You build secure web applications following modern web development practices <br />● You should be comfortable with version control systems (git) <br />● Some knowledge of Python web frameworks is a plus, but not essential <br />● You value a culture where the quality of code is as important as time-to-market <br />● You have a history of building and taking products to market in fast-paced environments<br /> ● You enjoy acquiring new skills and expertise as required by the project <br />● You have a bias for simplicity, scalability, robustness and maintainability in code and systems <br />● You design architectures which allow rapid iterations whilst considering future requirements and the big picture when planning and developing new applications and features <br />● You have great team skills, including the confidence to put your idea across, even if the idea is initially unpopular, and the humility to admit when you are wrong <br /><br /> <br />Responsibilities <br /><br />● Full lifecycle (ideation, building and deploying) responsibility for the Kopernio plugin <br />● Serve as the initial point of escalation for software development issues within your area of responsibility <br />● Interface with other technical team members to finalise requirements <br /> <br /> <br />About us <br /><br />We are a team of successful entrepreneurs and engineers, having built several companies in our field that have had a major impact on science, and with Kopernio we’re doing it again. It is a true start-up where a “can-do” attitude is valued more than any process, and where we want to push boundaries by breaking things. We put a strong emphasis on working independently and creatively, trying to find solutions to complex problems in an iterative way. You will be exposed to the world of start-ups, yet we will be clear on our purpose and objectives to advance science and help scientists to become more efficient. <br /> <br />As we grow, we are committed to building cohesive teams where communication, support and innovation thrives. We expect the team to actively contribute ideas and proactively take decisions in the interest of Kopernio and our users. <br /> <br /> "
