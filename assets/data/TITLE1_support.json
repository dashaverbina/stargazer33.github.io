That sounds like the perfect position for me…&nbsp; but I need a full-time job!”&nbsp; Well, you’re in luck. For the first time ever, we’re opening a full-time support position to outside candidates. We’re pretty excited about it, and hope you are too!</p><p>As YNAB continues to grow, we are looking for an experienced, technically-savvy, Customer Support Rep to join us! This is a full-time, remote position with a schedule that includes one weekend day. We would establish a set weekly schedule that works well for you and the team, but we expect to hire someone who can work an 8-hour shift between the hours of 9am – 9pm Eastern.</p><p>You might be a perfect fit. You’ll know it if you’re somewhat of a YNAB wizard already, you have a background in email or chat support, and you’re known for your ability to explain complicated things in a way anyone can understand.</p><p>We love our YNAB customers, and we want to make sure they love their support experience. You’ll look forward to every email and chat message, because it’s an opportunity to help another person gain control of their money and become a better budgeter.</p><p>That’s a super-brief intro, and there’s a lot more to it. But first, you need to know if you’ll even like working with us. (We think you will.)</p><h2><strong>A Bit About Us</strong></h2><p>We build the best budgeting software around, YNAB or You Need a Budget if you have a lot of extra time on your hands. For more than a decade, people have been using YNAB and then telling their friends what a difference it has made in their lives. (, or read some of our reviews on the App Store, and you’ll see what we mean.) We love building something that has a huge positive impact on people’s lives.</p><p>We’re profitable, bootstrapped, and growing. YNAB started in 2004, and we haven’t taken any outside funding—we’re in it for the long haul.</p><p>We have one overarching requirement when it comes to joining our team: our&nbsp;&nbsp;has to really click with you. If you’re nodding emphatically while reading it, you’ll probably fit right in, in which case, we can’t wait to hear from you!</p><p>First, let’s talk about life at YNAB, and then we’ll go into detail about what we’re looking for.</p><h2><strong>Who You’d Be Working With:</strong></h2><p><strong>Emma</strong>&nbsp;is our CS onboarding owner—which means she has the best job ever. She gets to walk you through your interviews, welcome you to the team, and help you get settled in your new role. When not searching for our next support stars, you can find her experimenting in the kitchen, exploring her new city, hanging out with her husband, or dreaming about the beach.</p><p><strong>Your manager:</strong>&nbsp;Your specific availability will impact what team you’re on and who your manager is, but trust us that they are all incredible! You can look forward to chatting with Jacob about delicious vegetarian restaurants, discussing Hamilton with Janelle, or giggling when Veronica’s horse dog makes an appearance during your weekly meetings. They each bring something unique to the YNAB team, and can’t wait to meet you.</p><p><strong>Your team:</strong>&nbsp;We have several email and chat teams, each comprised of both full-time and part-time reps. You’ll get to know your new colleagues through the team Slack channels and in regular team meetings where you’ll chat about team goals and&nbsp; projects. While we’ve grown a lot in the last few years, we work hard to maintain a close-knit team culture where everyone is passionate and excited about the work they do.</p><h2><strong>How You’ll Work at YNAB</strong></h2><p>We work really hard to make working at YNAB an amazing experience. We have a team full of truly exceptional people—the kind you’ll be excited to work with. Here’s how we operate:</p><h4>Live Where You Want</h4><p>We’re a distributed team, so you can live and work wherever you want. Proximity doesn’t influence productivity, and as we continue to increase our global reach, we’d love to have more team members in other timezones to help deliver timely responses to users. Our only requirement is that you have a reliable internet connection and can focus on work during your scheduled shift!</p><h4>Take Vacation (Seriously)</h4><p>We want you to take vacation. In fact, we have a minimum vacation policy of three weeks per year (plus two extra weeks for Christmas break). It’s important to get out and do something. We’ll look forward to seeing pictures of your vacation in our internal chat room, creatively named #office_wall.</p><h4>The YNAB Retreat</h4><p>We get the full-time team together once a year to catch up on spreadsheets and powerpoints in a Best Western conference room. Just kidding. So far, we’ve done&nbsp;, a&nbsp;&nbsp;in the mountains, a beach house in the Outer Banks, and a ranch in Montana. We do really fun things, but the highlight is always just hanging out together and having a blast.</p><h4>Up Your Game</h4><p>We’re serious about helping you improve your craft. We budget for it (hey-o!). Think conferences, books, dedicated time away from work to learn something new… it’s really up to you and your manager. But we love to see our people growing.</p><h4>If You’re International…</h4><p>You’ll be set up as a contractor. Employee or contractor, it’s all the same to us. You’re part of the team. As for time zones, we’re flexible as long as as the shift time works for you.</p><h4>If You’re Stateside…</h4><p>You’ll be a W2 employee with fantastic health, dental, and vision insurance, where we cover 100% of the premium for you and your family. (No need to check your vision, you read that right, 100%. Although if you did need to check your vision, no big deal, we’ve got you covered!)</p><p>We also have Traditional and Roth 401k options. YNAB contributes three percent whether you choose to throw any money in there or not. It vests immediately. (Are you a personal finance junkie like Jesse? He set up YNAB’s 401k to have the lowest fee structure possible, where all plan costs are paid by YNAB, not your retirement nest egg. The investment funds available are fantastic, passively-managed, ultra low-cost index funds. You’re not a PF junkie? Then trust us, it’s great.)</p><h2><strong>Other Tidbits</strong></h2><ul><li>Once you start, we DEMAND (in a friendly, ALL CAPS IS YELLING way) that you fill out your “Bucket List” spreadsheet with 50 items. (That’s harder than it sounds!)</li><li>The bucket list helps in deciding what we should give you for your birthday and Christmas: No gift cards here. We tried that. Super boring.</li><li>We have a bonus plan based on profitability. You’ll be in on that from day one. YNAB wins, you win. That kind of thing.</li><li>We want you firing on all cylinders so we’ll set you up with a shiny new computer and replace it every three years.</li><li>Did I mention we make a&nbsp;<a href='https://www.youneedabudget.com/category/budgeting-success-stories/' rel='nofollow'>huge, positive difference</a>&nbsp;in people’s lives? We have a Slack channel where we share success stories from our customers daily. It’s amazing. Don’t underestimate this one!</li></ul><p>If this sounds like your ideal environment, read on because now we want to talk about you. You will play a big part in helping YNAB delight users and give them control of their money.&nbsp; You will change lives.</p><h2><strong>Now, back to you, our new Support Rep…</strong></h2><p>First and foremost, you have customer support experience. You understand the importance of balancing directness, accuracy, personalization and speed, and are comfortable taking on the most difficult conversations. Your past support jobs have given you a great foundation and understanding of the customer experience, and you’re ready to learn from us, while simultaneously teaching the YNAB team something as well.</p><p>Not only are you a customer support professional, you’re also incredibly passionate about it. You’ll set aside part of your shift to review conversations, read support-focused books and articles, and dive in to how you can do your job better. You don’t view support as a stepping stone, it is your career, and you’re eager to grow with us.</p><p>You love problem solving. You’ll have the impossible task of seeing the forest and the trees. You’ll dive into the depths of a customer’s issue, infer from their (sometimes vague) descriptions of exactly what’s going on, anticipate where they’ll trip up next, and clearly explain what they need to do in order to continue having success with YNAB.</p><p>You will be the face of YNAB. You don’t mind answering the same question multiple times in the same day, because it’s a different customer each time—another chance to make someone’s day. You manage to exceed expectations even when you deliver a different answer than the customer was hoping for.</p><p>You’re really good at switching gears. You’ll answer three emails in a row—one about how to get a reluctant spouse to budget, the next about a bank not pulling in transactions, and another from a college student who realized they really need a budget for all their pizza and ramen—and not miss a beat.</p><p>You know that speed of response is extremely important, but you can walk that fine line between speed and accuracy. You are a master of being direct and friendly within the same sentence, and consistently send a minimum of 10 personalized replies per hour.</p><p>You play really nicely with others. You’re flexible. You adapt and adjust. When we implement a new feedback tracking system, it’s your best week ever.</p><p>You love to learn. You love constructive feedback because it helps you improve. You pick up conversations mid-stream from a colleague who is off for the weekend, and offer a virtual high-five when the conversation is closed: customer satisfied.</p><p>You love taking that one little extra step beyond what’s expected. You’re creative in that way. You consistently force us to ask you questions like, “How did you know the customer meant ‘x’, when he was saying ‘y’ the whole time?”</p><p>You’re open minded. While you have support experience, you’re not afraid to learn about how we do things at YNAB. Our team goes above and beyond what’s expected and delivers exceptionally personalized responses, and you’re excited about learning the YNAB support ropes.</p><h2><strong>A Day in the Life…</strong></h2><p>Our full-time reps spend 30 hours each week answering emails or working in chat support, and 10 hours working on projects, in meetings, and improving their craft. This averages out to 6 hours working with customers, and 2 hours of additional tasks each day. You always know your schedule, because it’s consistent week after week. Let’s say you work Tuesday through Saturday from 12pm – 8pm ET. It’s Wednesday, and you’ve opened your laptop to start your shift. You clock in and spend a few minutes catching up on just the important updates since yesterday (there’s a Slack channel for that).</p><p>It’s the first day of the month, so the queue is busier than usual, but expected. To warm up, you hop into a couple of the newest emails. It’s an opportunity to really make someone’s day by getting a response within moments of writing in.</p><p>Then, you head to the back of the queue and pick up a couple of the oldest ones. You’re often surprised by the complexity of questions you see, but you’re excited for the challenge each one brings. And you know you can skip the ones beyond your knowledge level, and come back to and review them during your 10 hours of development time each week. They may be above your knowledge level now, but in a few short months you’ll be answering them with ease. In fact, you’ll probably become an expert in one particular area and others will look to you for help.</p><p>Today you have your weekly one-to-one with your manager, so you hop on a video call and talk about your metrics, craft goals, and bring up some ideas you have on how to better organize our internal help docs.</p><p>After a productive meeting, you wrap up a few conversations, then spend the last hour of your shift outside of the queue. There are a couple new internal knowledge articles on your reading list, and you’re planning to share a post in the #cs_grow channel about a few lessons you learned recently about tone matching.</p><p>Before you know it, it’s time to fill out your quick Daily Reflection and clock out!</p><h2><strong>You’re the One We’re Looking If:</strong></h2><ul><li>You have at least&nbsp; 2 years experience in an email, chat, or phone support role (required).</li><li>You’ll be able to send at least 10 replies per hour.</li><li>You could flawlessly juggle three live chat conversations at a time.</li><li>You can commit to 40 hours per week, with one shift on Saturday or Sunday</li><li>You value excellence and continuous improvement. At the same time.</li><li>You understand how every support response is an expression of the YNAB culture and brand.</li><li>Other people consider you a stellar communicator.</li><li>You love making people happy.</li><li>People thank you when you deliver difficult news. You’re that good.</li><li>You enjoy trying things you haven’t ever done before.</li><li>You aren’t afraid to ask questions.</li><li>You are wildly productive and independent, but a team-player at heart.</li></ul><h2><strong>Bonus Points:</strong></h2><ul><li>You already use and love YNAB.</li><li>You have experience working remotely</li></ul><p>And, since our job descriptions are already so long, what’s another sentence or two…</p><p>YNAB is an equal opportunity employer. We believe diversity of backgrounds, beliefs, and experiences to be critical to our success and are passionate about creating a welcoming, supportive, and collaborative environment for all employees. All are encouraged to apply as we continue to grow a smart, hard-working, and diverse team who love working together to build something that matters.</p><h2><strong>How to&nbsp; Apply:</strong></h2><ul><li><strong>Apply by 11:59PM on July 19, 2018. Firm. It’s a real deadline.</strong></li><li>Attach a PDF of your cover letter, and in your cover letter include:<ul><li>Why this position is of interest to you, and why you would be a great fit?</li><li>Your secret to great customer support.</li><li>Your answer to the questions: Is the customer always right? Why or why not?</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li>If you have a prepared resume, attach it in PDF form. If you don’t have a resume because you aren’t even sure you’re looking to change jobs, that’s fine! An informal list of your work and education history are all we’re looking for.</li></ul><div> <a href='https://ynab.recruiterbox.com/jobs/fk01pyi' rel='nofollow'>Apply for job</a></div></div>"

    "content": "We’re looking for someone who’s experienced at managing relationships to join our team and play a crucial (and exciting) role helping our customers make the most of our technology and approach. Whilst you will have the opportunity to work from home, this role will involve working at customer sites, the vast majority of which are in Central London. <br /><br />*Your role will involve:* <br /><br />* A bit of consulting; <br />* A bit of customer support; <br />* A bit of detective work; and<br />* Plenty of opportunity to exercise your strategic and creative sides, as you may be planning and producing short videos and writing copy in order to build digital resources. <br /><br />If you’re not familiar with what digital resources are then don’t worry. What’s more important to us is that you have some experience dealing with (or working in) large-ish companies, you are great at managing relationships, and that you have a bit of a flair for producing written content.<br /><br />*What we do:* <br />It seems quite grand but we really do transform the way that business people work, learn and grow as professionals, with Looop’s innovative Digital Learning Platform and methodology. And we do this working with some of the most progressive and well-known companies in the world. <br /><br />*Who we are:*<br />Looop is a post-revenue, high-growth technology start-up, which means (in real language) we've done the really hard bit, turning a great idea into a business, and now we're growing the team to build on our initial success!<br /><br />Since 2014, we've been challenging the Learning & Development (L&D) industry to catch up with the way that technology enhances our daily lives: to ditch rubbish e-learning and keep out of the training room! By doing this, L&D can help everybody be better at their jobs and take on exciting new roles.<br /><br />Our customers are not just companies who pay us in exchange for tech. We build deep relationships with the brilliant people at ASOS, Amazon, Sky, Financial Times, and more, and they rely on us for thought-leading, practical support to get better results through their Learning & Development.<br /><br />As people, we are experts at what we do, driven to make a difference, and friends who like working with each other. We challenge and support each other to be the best we can be and celebrate the many successes we have along the way.<br /><br />*The exciting new role in our team:*<br />Our customers have come to rely on our expertise and responsiveness and we are looking for someone to help them with this. So, we're looking for somebody to join us who wants to:<br /><br />Help the brilliant and ambitious people, that we’re fortunate enough to call our customers, to do what they want to do with Looop… but better. You'll do this by responding to - and anticipating - their needs and staying close to them, leading them on their way, and providing expert, hands-on support;<br /><br />Help deliver consulting services to our customers following our proven (and improving) Looop methodology, which will include:<br /><br />* Helping them unpack business performance problems using the Looop methodology<br />* Designing and building resources<br />* Designing and leading campaigns for engagement<br />* Helping to quantify and report successful campaigns;<br />* Continuously improve Looop’s customer onboarding - and subsequent experiences - so their entire organisation benefits from what we know they can achieve with us.<br /><br />*Experience:*<br />We are really pushing our customers to think differently about their L&D and their business, and - in so doing - we’re helping them to improve. For this reason, we need somebody with at least some experience of working in a corporate environment. <br /><br />Developing ‘content’ is also a core element of this role, which will mean designing and building of learning resources as well as gaining high user-engagement, with the skills for this including writing, basic video production and running marketing campaigns.<br /><br />*You are:*<br />Real customer success comes from the heart.  You believe in what you do and are passionate about engaging people and driving positive change in business through the use of innovative technology. If this is you, we’d love you to speak with you!<br /><br />Many of the world’s most exciting and progressive companies are transforming their Learning & Development by adopting our technology and our approach, and we would love your help in taking care of them.<br /><br />*If you sound like the right person for this role then please apply below.*"

This is a full-time, remote position with a schedule that includes one weekend day. We would establish a set weekly schedule that works well for you and the team, but we expect to hire someone who can work their shift between the hours of 9am – 9pm Eastern.</p><p>You might be a perfect fit. You’ll know it if you’re somewhat of a YNAB wizard already, you have a background in email or chat support, and you’re known for your ability to explain complicated things in a way anyone can understand.</p><p>We love our YNAB customers, and we want to make sure they love their support experience. You’ll look forward to every email and chat message, because it’s an opportunity to help another person gain control of their money and become a better budgeter.</p><p>That’s a super-brief intro, and there’s a lot more to it. But first, you need to know if you’ll even like working with us. (We think you will.)</p><h4><strong>A Bit About Us</strong></h4><p>We build the best budgeting software around, YNAB or You Need a Budget if you have a lot of extra time on your hands. For more than a decade, people have been using YNAB and then telling their friends what a difference it has made in their lives. (<a href='https://www.google.com/search?q=ynab' rel='nofollow'>Google us</a>, or read some of our reviews on the App Store, and you’ll see what we mean.) We love building something that has a huge positive impact on people’s lives.</p><p>We’re profitable, bootstrapped, and growing. YNAB started in 2004, and we haven’t taken any outside funding—we’re in it for the long haul.</p><p>We have one overarching requirement when it comes to joining our team: our&nbsp;<a href='https://docs.google.com/document/d/16hufsixsrv1j2jZkWUgQmeKpNfQRsacnnK2xTVwO0ew/edit?usp=sharing' rel='nofollow'>Cultural Manifesto</a>&nbsp;has to really click with you. If you’re nodding emphatically while reading it, you’ll probably fit right in, in which case, we can’t wait to hear from you!</p><p>First, let’s talk about life at YNAB, and then we’ll go into detail about what we’re looking for.</p><h4><strong>WHO YOU’D BE WORKING WITH:</strong></h4><p>Emma&nbsp;is our CS onboarding owner—which means she has the best job ever. She gets to walk you through your interviews, welcome you to the team, and help you get settled in your new role. When not searching for our next support stars, you can find her experimenting in the kitchen, exploring her new city, hanging out with her husband, or dreaming about the beach.</p><p>Your manager:&nbsp;Your specific availability will impact what team you’re on and who your manager is, but trust us that they are all incredible! You can look forward to chatting with Jacob about delicious vegetarian restaurants, discussing Hamilton with Janelle, or giggling when Veronica’s horse dog makes an appearance during your weekly meetings. They each bring something unique to the YNAB team, and can’t wait to meet you.</p><p>Your team:&nbsp;We have several email and chat teams, each comprised of both full-time and part-time reps. You’ll get to know your new colleagues through the team Slack channels and in regular team meetings where you’ll chat about team goals and&nbsp; projects. While we’ve grown a lot in the last few years, we work hard to maintain a close-knit team culture where everyone is passionate and excited about the work they do.</p><h4><strong>HOW YOU’LL WORK AT YNAB</strong></h4><p>We work really hard to make working at YNAB an amazing experience. We have a team full of truly exceptional people—the kind you’ll be excited to work with. Here’s how we operate:</p><h4><strong>Live Where You Want</strong></h4><p>We’re a distributed team, so you can live and work wherever you want. Proximity doesn’t influence productivity, and as we continue to increase our global reach, we’d love to have more team members in other timezones to help deliver timely responses to users. Our only requirement is that you have a reliable internet connection and can focus on work during your scheduled shift!</p><h4><strong>Take Vacation (Seriously)</strong></h4><p>We want you to take vacation. In fact, we have a minimum vacation policy of three weeks per year (plus two extra weeks for Christmas break). It’s important to get out and do something. We’ll look forward to seeing pictures of your vacation in our internal chat room, creatively named #office_wall.</p><h4><strong>The YNAB Retreat</strong></h4><p>We get the full-time team together once a year to catch up on spreadsheets and powerpoints in a Best Western conference room. Just kidding. So far, we’ve done&nbsp;<a href='https://vimeo.com/youneedabudget/review/120084054/93e11d6343' rel='nofollow'>Costa Rica</a>, a&nbsp;<a href='https://www.youneedabudget.com/if-you-feel-guilty-spending-money-youre-doing-it-wrong/' rel='nofollow'>gigantic cabin</a>&nbsp;in the mountains, a beach house in the Outer Banks, and a ranch in Montana. We do really fun things, but the highlight is always just hanging out together and having a blast.</p><h4><strong>UP YOUR GAME</strong></h4><p>We’re serious about helping you improve your craft. We budget for it (hey-o!). Think conferences, books, dedicated time away from work to learn something new… it’s really up to you and your manager. But we love to see our people growing.</p><h4><strong>IF YOU’RE INTERNATIONAL…</strong></h4><p>You’ll be set up as a contractor. Employee or contractor, it’s all the same to us. You’re part of the team. As for time zones, we’re flexible as long as as the shift time works for you.</p><h4><strong>IF YOU’RE STATESIDE…</strong></h4><p>You’ll be a W2 employee with fantastic health, dental, and vision insurance, where we cover 100% of the premium for you and your family. (No need to check your vision, you read that right, 100%. Although if you did need to check your vision, no big deal, we’ve got you covered!)</p><p>We also have Traditional and Roth 401k options. YNAB contributes three percent whether you choose to throw any money in there or not. It vests immediately. (Are you a personal finance junkie like Jesse? He set up YNAB’s 401k to have the lowest fee structure possible, where all plan costs are paid by YNAB, not your retirement nest egg. The investment funds available are fantastic, passively-managed, ultra low-cost index funds. You’re not a PF junkie? Then trust us, it’s great.)</p><h4><strong>OTHER TIDBITS</strong></h4><ul><li>Once you start, we DEMAND (in a friendly, ALL CAPS IS YELLING way) that you fill out your “Bucket List” spreadsheet with 50 items. (That’s harder than it sounds!)</li><li>The bucket list helps in deciding what we should give you for your birthday and Christmas: No gift cards here. We tried that. Super boring.</li><li>We have a bonus plan based on profitability. You’ll be in on that from day one. YNAB wins, you win. That kind of thing.</li><li>We want you firing on all cylinders so we’ll set you up with a shiny new computer and replace it every three years.</li><li>Did I mention we make a&nbsp;<a href='https://www.youneedabudget.com/category/budgeting-success-stories/' rel='nofollow'>huge, positive difference</a>&nbsp;in people’s lives? We have a Slack channel where we share success stories from our customers daily. It’s amazing. Don’t underestimate this one!</li></ul><p>If this sounds like your ideal environment, read on because now we want to talk about you. You will play a big part in helping YNAB delight users and give them control of their money.&nbsp; You will change lives.</p><h4><strong>Now, back to you, our new Support Rep…</strong></h4><p>First and foremost, you have customer support experience. You understand the importance of balancing directness, accuracy, personalization and speed, and are comfortable taking on the most difficult conversations. Your past support jobs have given you a great foundation and understanding of the customer experience, and you’re ready to learn from us, while simultaneously teaching the YNAB team something as well.</p><p>Not only are you a customer support professional, you’re also incredibly passionate about it. You’ll set aside part of your shift to review conversations, read support-focused books and articles, and dive in to how you can do your job better. You don’t view support as a stepping stone, it is your career, and you’re eager to grow with us.</p><p>You love problem solving. You’ll have the impossible task of seeing the forest and the trees. You’ll dive into the depths of a customer’s issue, infer from their (sometimes vague) descriptions of exactly what’s going on, anticipate where they’ll trip up next, and clearly explain what they need to do in order to continue having success with YNAB.</p><p>You will be the face of YNAB. You don’t mind answering the same question multiple times in the same day, because it’s a different customer each time—another chance to make someone’s day. You manage to exceed expectations even when you deliver a different answer than the customer was hoping for.</p><p>You’re really good at switching gears. You’ll answer three emails in a row—one about how to get a reluctant spouse to budget, the next about a bank not pulling in transactions, and another from a college student who realized they really need a budget for all their pizza and ramen—and not miss a beat.</p><p>You know that speed of response is extremely important, but you can walk that fine line between speed and accuracy. You are a master of being direct and friendly within the same sentence, and consistently send a minimum of 10 personalized replies per hour.</p><p>You play really nicely with others. You’re flexible. You adapt and adjust. When we implement a new feedback tracking system, it’s your best week ever.</p><p>You love to learn. You love constructive feedback because it helps you improve. You pick up conversations mid-stream from a colleague who is off for the weekend, and offer a virtual high-five when the conversation is closed: customer satisfied.</p><p>You love taking that one little extra step beyond what’s expected. You’re creative in that way. You consistently force us to ask you questions like, “How did you know the customer meant ‘x’, when he was saying ‘y’ the whole time?”</p><p>You’re open minded. While you have support experience, you’re not afraid to learn about how we do things at YNAB. Our team goes above and beyond what’s expected and delivers exceptionally personalized responses, and you’re excited about learning the YNAB support ropes.</p><h4><strong>A DAY IN THE LIFE…</strong></h4><p>Our full-time reps spend 30 hours each week answering emails or working in chat support, and 10 hours working on projects, in meetings, and improving their craft. This averages out to 6 hours working with customers, and 2 hours of additional tasks each day. You always know your schedule, because it’s consistent week after week. Let’s say you work Tuesday through Saturday from 12pm – 8pm ET. It’s Wednesday, and you’ve opened your laptop to start your shift. You clock in and spend a few minutes catching up on just the important updates since yesterday (there’s a Slack channel for that).</p><p>It’s the first day of the month, so the queue is busier than usual, but expected. To warm up, you hop into a couple of the newest emails. It’s an opportunity to really make someone’s day by getting a response within moments of writing in.</p><p>Then, you head to the back of the queue and pick up a couple of the oldest ones. You’re often surprised by the complexity of questions you see, but you’re excited for the challenge each one brings. And you know you can skip the ones beyond your knowledge level, and come back to and review them during your 10 hours of development time each week. They may be above your knowledge level now, but in a few short months you’ll be answering them with ease. In fact, you’ll probably become an expert in one particular area and others will look to you for help.</p><p>Today you have your weekly one-to-one with your manager, so you hop on a video call and talk about your metrics, craft goals, and bring up some ideas you have on how to better organize our internal help docs.</p><p>After a productive meeting, you wrap up a few conversations, then spend the last hour of your shift outside of the queue. There are a couple new internal knowledge articles on your reading list, and you’re planning to share a post in the #cs_grow channel about a few lessons you learned recently about tone matching.</p><p>Before you know it, it’s time to fill out your quick Daily Reflection and clock out!</p><h4><strong>YOU’RE THE ONE WE’RE LOOKING FOR IF:</strong></h4><ul><li>You have at least&nbsp; 2 years experience in an email, chat, or phone support role (required).</li><li>You’ll be able to send at least 10 replies per hour.</li><li>You could flawlessly juggle three live chat conversations at a time.</li><li>You can commit to 40 hours per week, with one shift on Saturday or Sunday</li><li>You value excellence and continuous improvement. At the same time.</li><li>You understand how every support response is an expression of the YNAB culture and brand.</li><li>Other people consider you a stellar communicator.</li><li>You love making people happy.</li><li>People thank you when you deliver difficult news. You’re that good.</li><li>You enjoy trying things you haven’t ever done before.</li><li>You aren’t afraid to ask questions.</li><li>You are wildly productive and independent, but a team-player at heart.</li></ul><h4><strong>BONUS POINTS:</strong></h4><ul><li>You already use and love YNAB.</li><li>You have experience working remotely</li></ul><p>And, since our job descriptions are already so long, what’s another sentence or two…</p><p>YNAB is an equal opportunity employer. We believe diversity of backgrounds, beliefs, and experiences to be critical to our success and are passionate about creating a welcoming, supportive, and collaborative environment for all employees.

That sounds like the perfect position for me…&nbsp; but I need a full-time job!”&nbsp; Well, you’re in luck. For the first time ever, we’re opening a full-time support position to outside candidates. We’re pretty excited about it, and hope you are too!&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>As YNAB continues to grow, we are looking for an experienced, technically-savvy, Customer Support Rep to join us! This is a full-time, remote position with a schedule that includes one weekend day. We would establish a set weekly schedule that works well for you and the team, but we expect to hire someone who can work their shift between the hours of 9am - 9pm Eastern.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>You might be a perfect fit. You’ll know it if you’re somewhat of a YNAB wizard already, you have a background in email or chat support, and you’re known for your ability to explain complicated things in a way anyone can understand.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>We love our YNAB customers, and we want to make sure they love their support experience. You’ll look forward to every email and chat message, because it’s an opportunity to help another person gain control of their money and become a better budgeter.</div><div><br></div><div>That’s a super-brief intro, and there’s a lot more to it. But first, you need to know if you’ll even like working with us. (We think you will.)</div><div><br></div><div><h3>A BIT ABOUT US:</h3></div><div>We build the best budgeting software around, YNAB or You Need a Budget if you have a lot of extra time on your hands. For more than a decade, people have been using YNAB and then telling their friends what a difference it has made in their lives. (<a href='https://www.google.com/search?q=ynab' rel='nofollow'>Google us</a>, or read some of our reviews on the App Store, and you’ll see what we mean.) We love building something that has a huge positive impact on people’s lives.</div><div><br></div><div>We’re profitable, bootstrapped, and growing. YNAB started in 2004, and we haven’t taken any outside funding—we’re in it for the long haul.</div><div><br></div><div>We have one overarching requirement when it comes to joining our team: our&nbsp;<a href='https://docs.google.com/document/d/16hufsixsrv1j2jZkWUgQmeKpNfQRsacnnK2xTVwO0ew/edit?usp=sharing' rel='nofollow'>Cultural Manifesto</a>&nbsp;has to really click with you. If you’re nodding emphatically while reading it, you’ll probably fit right in, in which case, we can’t wait to hear from you!</div><div><br></div><div>First, let’s talk about life at YNAB, and then we’ll go into detail about what we’re looking for.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><h3>WHO YOU’D BE WORKING WITH:</h3></div><div><span>Emma</span>&nbsp;is our CS onboarding owner—which means she has the best job ever. She gets to walk you through your interviews, welcome you to the team, and help you get settled in your new role. When not searching for our next support stars, you can find her experimenting in the kitchen, exploring her new city, hanging out with her husband, or dreaming about the beach.</div><div><br></div><div><span>Your manager:</span>&nbsp;Your specific availability will impact what team you’re on and who your manager is, but trust us that they are all incredible! You can look forward to chatting with Jacob about delicious vegetarian restaurants, discussing Hamilton with Janelle, or giggling when Veronica’s horse dog makes an appearance during your weekly meetings. They each bring something unique to the YNAB team, and can’t wait to meet you.&nbsp;</div><div><span>Your team:</span>&nbsp;We have several email and chat teams, each comprised of both full-time and part-time reps. You’ll get to know your new colleagues through the team Slack channels and in regular team meetings where you’ll chat about team goals and&nbsp; projects. While we’ve grown a lot in the last few years, we work hard to maintain a close-knit team culture where everyone is passionate and excited about the work they do.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><h3>HOW YOU’LL WORK AT YNAB</h3></div><div>We work really hard to make working at YNAB an amazing experience. We have a team full of truly exceptional people—the kind you’ll be excited to work with. Here’s how we operate:</div><div><br></div><div><h4>Live Where You Want</h4></div><div>We’re a distributed team, so you can live and work wherever you want. Proximity doesn’t influence productivity, and as we continue to increase our global reach, we’d love to have more team members in other timezones to help deliver timely responses to users. Our only requirement is that you have a reliable internet connection and can focus on work during your scheduled shift!</div><div><br></div><div><h4>Take Vacation (Seriously)</h4></div><div>We want you to take vacation. In fact, we have a minimum vacation policy of three weeks per year (plus two extra weeks for Christmas break). It’s important to get out and do something. We’ll look forward to seeing pictures of your vacation in our internal chat room, creatively named #office_wall.</div><div><br></div><div><h4>The YNAB Retreat</h4></div><div>We get the full-time team together once a year to catch up on spreadsheets and powerpoints in a Best Western conference room. Just kidding. So far, we’ve done&nbsp;<a href='https://vimeo.com/youneedabudget/review/120084054/93e11d6343' rel='nofollow'>Costa Rica</a>, a&nbsp;<a href='https://www.youneedabudget.com/if-you-feel-guilty-spending-money-youre-doing-it-wrong/' rel='nofollow'>gigantic cabin</a>&nbsp;in the mountains, a beach house in the Outer Banks, and a ranch in Montana. We do really fun things, but the highlight is always just hanging out together and having a blast.</div><div><br></div><div><h4>UP YOUR GAME</h4></div><div>We’re serious about helping you improve your craft. We budget for it (hey-o!). Think conferences, books, dedicated time away from work to learn something new… it’s really up to you and your manager. But we love to see our people growing.</div><div><br></div><div><h4>IF YOU’RE INTERNATIONAL…</h4></div><div>You’ll be set up as a contractor. Employee or contractor, it’s all the same to us. You’re part of the team. As for time zones, we’re flexible as long as as the shift time works for you.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><h4>IF YOU’RE STATESIDE…</h4></div><div>You’ll be a W2 employee with fantastic health, dental, and vision insurance, where we cover 100% of the premium for you and your family. (No need to check your vision, you read that right, 100%. Although if you did need to check your vision, no big deal, we’ve got you covered!)</div><div><br></div><div>We also have Traditional and Roth 401k options. YNAB contributes three percent whether you choose to throw any money in there or not. It vests immediately. (Are you a personal finance junkie like Jesse? He set up YNAB’s 401k to have the lowest fee structure possible, where all plan costs are paid by YNAB, not your retirement nest egg. The investment funds available are fantastic, passively-managed, ultra low-cost index funds. You’re not a PF junkie? Then trust us, it’s great.)</div><div><br></div><div><h3>OTHER TIDBITS:</h3></div><ul><li>Once you start, we DEMAND (in a friendly, ALL CAPS IS YELLING way) that you fill out your “Bucket List” spreadsheet with 50 items. (That’s harder than it sounds!)</li><li>The bucket list helps in deciding what we should give you for your birthday and Christmas: No gift cards here. We tried that. Super boring.</li><li>We have a bonus plan based on profitability. You’ll be in on that from day one. YNAB wins, you win.

That sounds like the perfect position for me…&nbsp; but I need a full-time job!”&nbsp; Well, you’re in luck. For the first time ever, we’re opening a full-time support position to outside candidates. We’re pretty excited about it, and hope you are too!&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>As YNAB continues to grow, we are looking for an experienced, technically-savvy, Customer Support Rep to join us! This is a full-time, remote position with a schedule that includes one weekend day. We would establish a set weekly schedule that works well for you and the team, but we expect to hire someone who can work their shift between the hours of 9am - 9pm Eastern.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>You might be a perfect fit. You’ll know it if you’re somewhat of a YNAB wizard already, you have a background in email or chat support, and you’re known for your ability to explain complicated things in a way anyone can understand.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>We love our YNAB customers, and we want to make sure they love their support experience. You’ll look forward to every email and chat message, because it’s an opportunity to help another person gain control of their money and become a better budgeter.</div><div><br></div><div>That’s a super-brief intro, and there’s a lot more to it. But first, you need to know if you’ll even like working with us. (We think you will.)</div><div><br></div><div><h3>A BIT ABOUT US:</h3></div><div>We build the best budgeting software around, YNAB or You Need a Budget if you have a lot of extra time on your hands. For more than a decade, people have been using YNAB and then telling their friends what a difference it has made in their lives. (<a href='https://www.google.com/search?q=ynab' rel='nofollow'>Google us</a>, or read some of our reviews on the App Store, and you’ll see what we mean.) We love building something that has a huge positive impact on people’s lives.</div><div><br></div><div>We’re profitable, bootstrapped, and growing. YNAB started in 2004, and we haven’t taken any outside funding—we’re in it for the long haul.</div><div><br></div><div>We have one overarching requirement when it comes to joining our team: our&nbsp;<a href='https://docs.google.com/document/d/16hufsixsrv1j2jZkWUgQmeKpNfQRsacnnK2xTVwO0ew/edit?usp=sharing' rel='nofollow'>Cultural Manifesto</a>&nbsp;has to really click with you. If you’re nodding emphatically while reading it, you’ll probably fit right in, in which case, we can’t wait to hear from you!</div><div><br></div><div>First, let’s talk about life at YNAB, and then we’ll go into detail about what we’re looking for.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><h3>WHO YOU’D BE WORKING WITH:</h3></div><div><span>Emma</span>&nbsp;is our CS onboarding owner—which means she has the best job ever. She gets to walk you through your interviews, welcome you to the team, and help you get settled in your new role. When not searching for our next support stars, you can find her experimenting in the kitchen, exploring her new city, hanging out with her husband, or dreaming about the beach.</div><div><br></div><div><span>Your manager:</span>&nbsp;Your specific availability will impact what team you’re on and who your manager is, but trust us that they are all incredible! You can look forward to chatting with Jacob about delicious vegetarian restaurants, discussing Hamilton with Janelle, or giggling when Veronica’s horse dog makes an appearance during your weekly meetings. They each bring something unique to the YNAB team, and can’t wait to meet you.&nbsp;</div><div><span>Your team:</span>&nbsp;We have several email and chat teams, each comprised of both full-time and part-time reps. You’ll get to know your new colleagues through the team Slack channels and in regular team meetings where you’ll chat about team goals and&nbsp; projects. While we’ve grown a lot in the last few years, we work hard to maintain a close-knit team culture where everyone is passionate and excited about the work they do.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><h3>HOW YOU’LL WORK AT YNAB</h3></div><div>We work really hard to make working at YNAB an amazing experience. We have a team full of truly exceptional people—the kind you’ll be excited to work with. Here’s how we operate:</div><div><br></div><div><h4>Live Where You Want</h4></div><div>We’re a distributed team, so you can live and work wherever you want. Proximity doesn’t influence productivity, and as we continue to increase our global reach, we’d love to have more team members in other timezones to help deliver timely responses to users. Our only requirement is that you have a reliable internet connection and can focus on work during your scheduled shift!</div><div><br></div><div><h4>Take Vacation (Seriously)</h4></div><div>We want you to take vacation. In fact, we have a minimum vacation policy of three weeks per year (plus two extra weeks for Christmas break). It’s important to get out and do something. We’ll look forward to seeing pictures of your vacation in our internal chat room, creatively named #office_wall.</div><div><br></div><div><h4>The YNAB Retreat</h4></div><div>We get the full-time team together once a year to catch up on spreadsheets and powerpoints in a Best Western conference room. Just kidding. So far, we’ve done&nbsp;<a href='https://vimeo.com/youneedabudget/review/120084054/93e11d6343' rel='nofollow'>Costa Rica</a>, a&nbsp;<a href='https://www.youneedabudget.com/if-you-feel-guilty-spending-money-youre-doing-it-wrong/' rel='nofollow'>gigantic cabin</a>&nbsp;in the mountains, a beach house in the Outer Banks, and a ranch in Montana. We do really fun things, but the highlight is always just hanging out together and having a blast.</div><div><br></div><div><h4>UP YOUR GAME</h4></div><div>We’re serious about helping you improve your craft. We budget for it (hey-o!). Think conferences, books, dedicated time away from work to learn something new… it’s really up to you and your manager. But we love to see our people growing.</div><div><br></div><div><h4>IF YOU’RE INTERNATIONAL…</h4></div><div>You’ll be set up as a contractor. Employee or contractor, it’s all the same to us. You’re part of the team. As for time zones, we’re flexible as long as as the shift time works for you.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><h4>IF YOU’RE STATESIDE…</h4></div><div>You’ll be a W2 employee with fantastic health, dental, and vision insurance, where we cover 100% of the premium for you and your family. (No need to check your vision, you read that right, 100%. Although if you did need to check your vision, no big deal, we’ve got you covered!)</div><div><br></div><div>We also have Traditional and Roth 401k options. YNAB contributes three percent whether you choose to throw any money in there or not. It vests immediately. (Are you a personal finance junkie like Jesse? He set up YNAB’s 401k to have the lowest fee structure possible, where all plan costs are paid by YNAB, not your retirement nest egg. The investment funds available are fantastic, passively-managed, ultra low-cost index funds. You’re not a PF junkie? Then trust us, it’s great.)</div><div><br></div><div><h3>OTHER TIDBITS:</h3></div><ul><li>Once you start, we DEMAND (in a friendly, ALL CAPS IS YELLING way) that you fill out your “Bucket List” spreadsheet with 50 items. (That’s harder than it sounds!)</li><li>The bucket list helps in deciding what we should give you for your birthday and Christmas: No gift cards here. We tried that. Super boring.</li><li>We have a bonus plan based on profitability. You’ll be in on that from day one. YNAB wins, you win. That kind of thing.</li><li>We want you firing on all cylinders so we’ll set you up with a shiny new computer and replace it every three years.</li><li>Did I mention we make a&nbsp;<a href='https://www.youneedabudget.com/category/budgeting-success-stories/' rel='nofollow'>huge, positive difference</a>&nbsp;in people’s lives? We have a Slack channel where we share success stories from our customers daily. It’s amazing. Don’t underestimate this one!</li></ul><div>If this sounds like your ideal environment, read on because now we want to talk about you. You will play a big part in helping YNAB delight users and give them control of their money.&nbsp; You will change lives.</div><div><br></div><div><h3>NOW, BACK TO YOU, OUR NEW SUPPORT REP...</h3></div><div>First and foremost, you have customer support experience. You understand the importance of balancing directness, accuracy, personalization and speed, and are comfortable taking on the most difficult conversations. Your past support jobs have given you a great foundation and understanding of the customer experience, and you’re ready to learn from us, while simultaneously teaching the YNAB team something as well.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Not only are you a customer support professional, you’re also incredibly passionate about it. You’ll set aside part of your shift to review conversations, read support-focused books and articles, and dive in to how you can do your job better. You don’t view support as a stepping stone, it is your career, and you’re eager to grow with us.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>You love problem solving. You’ll have the impossible task of seeing the forest and the trees. You’ll dive into the depths of a customer’s issue, infer from their (sometimes vague) descriptions of exactly what’s going on, anticipate where they’ll trip up next, and clearly explain what they need to do in order to continue having success with YNAB.</div><div><br></div><div>You will be the face of YNAB. You don’t mind answering the same question multiple times in the same day, because it’s a different customer each time—another chance to make someone’s day. You manage to exceed expectations even when you deliver a different answer than the customer was hoping for.</div><div><br></div><div>You’re really good at switching gears. You’ll answer three emails in a row—one about how to get a reluctant spouse to budget, the next about a bank not pulling in transactions, and another from a college student who realized they really need a budget for all their pizza and ramen—and not miss a beat.</div><div><br></div><div>You know that speed of response is extremely important, but you can walk that fine line between speed and accuracy. You are a master of being direct and friendly within the same sentence, and consistently send a minimum of 10 personalized replies per hour.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>You play really nicely with others. You’re flexible. You adapt and adjust. When we implement a new feedback tracking system, it’s your best week ever.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>You love to learn. You love constructive feedback because it helps you improve. You pick up conversations mid-stream from a colleague who is off for the weekend, and offer a virtual high-five when the conversation is closed: customer satisfied.</div><div><br></div><div>You love taking that one little extra step beyond what’s expected. You’re creative in that way. You consistently force us to ask you questions like, “How did you know the customer meant ‘x’, when he was saying ‘y’ the whole time?”&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>You’re open minded. While you have support experience, you’re not afraid to learn about how we do things at YNAB. Our team goes above and beyond what’s expected and delivers exceptionally personalized responses, and you’re excited about learning the YNAB support ropes.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><h3>A DAY IN THE LIFE…</h3></div><div>Our full-time reps spend 30 hours each week answering emails or working in chat support, and 10 hours working on projects, in meetings, and improving their craft. This averages out to 6 hours working with customers, and 2 hours of additional tasks each day. You always know your schedule, because it’s consistent week after week. Let’s say you work Tuesday through Saturday from 12pm – 8pm ET. It’s Wednesday, and you’ve opened your laptop to start your shift. You clock in and spend a few minutes catching up on just the important updates since yesterday (there’s a Slack channel for that).</div><div><br></div><div>It’s the first day of the month, so the queue is busier than usual, but expected. To warm up, you hop into a couple of the newest emails. It’s an opportunity to really make someone’s day by getting a response within moments of writing in.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Then, you head to the back of the queue and pick up a couple of the oldest ones. You’re often surprised by the complexity of questions you see, but you’re excited for the challenge each one brings. And you know you can skip the ones beyond your knowledge level, and come back to and review them during your 10 hours of development time each week. They may be above your knowledge level now, but in a few short months you’ll be answering them with ease. In fact, you'll probably become an expert in one particular area and others will look to you for help.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Today you have your weekly one-to-one with your manager, so you hop on a video call and talk about your metrics, craft goals, and bring up some ideas you have on how to better organize our internal help docs.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>After a productive meeting, you wrap up a few conversations, then spend the last hour of your shift outside of the queue. There are a couple new internal knowledge articles on your reading list, and you’re planning to share a post in the #cs_grow channel about a few lessons you learned recently about tone matching.</div><div><br></div><div>Before you know it, it’s time to fill out your quick Daily Reflection and clock out!&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><h3>YOU’RE THE ONE WE’RE LOOKING FOR IF:</h3></div><ul><li>You have at least&nbsp; 2 years experience in an email, chat, or phone support role (required).</li><li>You’ll be able to send at least 10 replies per hour.</li><li>You could flawlessly juggle three live chat conversations at a time.</li><li>You can commit to 40 hours per week, with one shift on Saturday or Sunday&nbsp;</li><li>You value excellence and continuous improvement. At the same time.</li><li>You understand how every support response is an expression of the YNAB culture and brand.</li><li>Other people consider you a stellar communicator.</li><li>You love making people happy.</li><li>People thank you when you deliver difficult news. You’re that good.</li><li>You enjoy trying things you haven’t ever done before.</li><li>You aren’t afraid to ask questions.</li><li>You are wildly productive and independent, but a team-player at heart.</li></ul><div><h3>BONUS POINTS:</h3></div><ul><li>You already use and love YNAB.</li><li>You have experience working remotely</li></ul><div>And, since our job descriptions are already so long, what’s another sentence or two…</div><div><br></div><div>YNAB is an equal opportunity employer. We believe diversity of backgrounds, beliefs, and experiences to be critical to our success and are passionate about creating a welcoming, supportive, and collaborative environment for all employees. All are encouraged to apply as we continue to grow a smart, hard-working, and diverse team who love working together to build something that matters.</div><div><br></div><div><h3>HOW TO APPLY:&nbsp;</h3></div><ul><li><span>Apply here (https://ynab.recruiterbox.com/jobs/fk01pyi) by 11:59PM on July 19, 2018. Firm. It’s a real deadline.</span></li><li>Attach a PDF of your cover letter, and in your cover letter include:</li><li><span>Why this position is of interest to you, and why you would be a great fit.</span></li><li><span>Your secret to great customer support.</span></li><li><span>Your answer to the questions: Is the customer always right? Why or why not?</span></li></ul><ul><li>If you have a prepared resume, attach it in PDF form. If you don’t have a resume because you aren’t even sure you’re looking to change jobs, that’s fine!

Once they're onboard, their trust is everything to us. As a Customer Success Specialist, you'll be the core of their relationship with the team at 1Password. You’ll help them with advanced use cases, bugs along the way, and ways to use the product so their team is more productive. And when they're considering an alternative before renewing their subscription, you'll even get to play relationship counselor by showing them 1Password's value.<br /><br />What you'll do<br /><br />- Be the well-written expert (without Grammarly) on 1Password for businesses who reach out with questions about eccentric use cases, unique bugs, and bold improvements.<br />- Help new 1Password Business clients get onboard post-sale and make sure they're set up for success in the long term.<br />- Proactively check in with clients to see how they're using the product, if they have questions they've been meaning to ask, and what they're enjoying about 1Password Business. Then discuss their feedback with the product team so they can improve the product and prioritize the right projects.<br />- Onsite training: Some companies need a dedicated person there to help them get started, so dust off the suitcase and those shoes you wore to a wedding that one time.<br />- Try new things: We're a flat organization so you can reach out to a developer for help when you need it, discuss a client's ideas with a designers, and make sure everyone feels heard. You're here to understand the direction of the product in the long run, and our clients do to.<br /><br />What you have<br /><br />- Adaptive explanatory skills that get people to understand, not just hear, what you're saying.<br />- Experience with how businesses use software, cybersecurity tools in particular, to be more productive, efficient, and safe.<br />- A personality that makes people smile and is delighted when they do. To you, the proverbial cup will always be half full.<br />- A knack for learning things on your own and quickly adapting to new environments. Since 1Password is remote, it’s important to be independent in your research, but also have the humility to ask for help when you aren't sure about something.<br />- An understanding that conversation is about listening, not every feature gets built, and how to say no.<br /><br />What you also might have<br /><br />- Some years of customer support under your belt – your friends tell you it's something you're great at and should try doing for a living.<br />- A track record with the acronyms SCIM, AD, CLI, SSO, and of course SAAS. <br />- Polyglottism! You could go to France or Germany for a week and jump right in to conversation, or do that from your computer, with a French riviera as your wallpaper.<br />- Personal experience with 1Password.<br /><br />Sounding like an ideal day for you? Tell us what you'd have for breakfast on that day."

    "content": "One in five households in the UK live in social housing, a sector with the right values at its core but that has historically struggled to deploy innovations in the home. Many residents still can’t afford to heat their homes and live in cold, mouldy properties they can’t be proud of. At Switchee, we believe that everyone deserves to live in a decent home and that the environments we inhabit have a massive influence on our ability to enjoy life and prosper.<br /><br />We may be only three years old, but it’s already been quite a ride! Our first product, the internet connected Switchee thermostat is already installed in 35 of the biggest housing providers in the UK. We’re growing 100% year on year and are backed by some of the best-known investors in technology and social impact.<br /><br />To strengthen our small team of 12 passionate and ambitious people we are looking for an outstanding individual to join us as a technically inclined<br /><br />*Customer* *Support* *Lead*<br /><br />We are driven by a collective desire to make a positive impact in the housing sector, both for residents and landlords, so your commitment to our values and mission are paramount<br /><br />*Your* *responsibilities*<br /><br />We are looking for an experienced Customer Support Lead to help us with our user and installer base.<br /><br />The role requires a high degree of initiative and an ability to manage a varied workload whilst under pressure. The successful candidate will be service focused and have a proactive/can do attitude combined with excellent communication skills<br /><br />Being more specific, you will:<br /><br />* Build and manage our customer support function<br />* Active receipt and solution of support calls and emails from users and installers<br />* Manage and set up out of hours contact centre<br />* Contribute to the development of the Switchee product through feature and bug reporting<br />* Develop marketing material to residents and installers<br />* Produce Helpline KPIs and database<br />* Support on deliveries, unit preparation and order logistics<br />* Contribute to the development and creation video content about the product<br />* Periodically being on-call for out of hours resident support<br />* As part of the team you may take part in other activities such as trade fairs / exhibitions, help with event setup and support the team during the show.<br /><br /><br />Switchee is a company built on a strong technical foundation. You will need to triage, problem-solve and communicate effectively with users and engineers. We also expect you to work closely with Product Development to ensure our product evolves with the customer’s needs at the very centre.<br /><br />*Your* *experience*<br /><br />We firmly believe extraordinary people can come from a wide range of places – but we wouldn’t be surprised if the person who gets this role has/is:<br /><br />* Technically inclined<br />* Experience in customer support, especially in call centre environment<br />* Excellent communicator<br />* Good at working under pressure, problem-solving<br />* Availability to attend end-user site visits<br />* Friendly and helpful person, excellent interpersonal skills<br />* Fluent speaking and writing in English. Other languages are also desirable<br /><br /><br />Ideal, but not essential:<br /><br />* Some understanding of heating systems<br />* Knowledge of helpdesk software e.g. Zendesk<br />* Experience in technical support by phone, email and on-site would be an advantage<br />* A background in social housing, energy efficiency or product.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />*You*<br /><br />We are a diverse bunch of people at Switchee. That said, there are some characteristics we always look for:<br /><br />* You deeply care about Switchee’s mission; you have a desire to build something revolutionary, that will disrupt an industry, and positively impact ordinary people’s lives.<br />* You care about the environment, are interested in energy efficiency and have thought about the challenges and opportunities posed by an evolving domestic energy market<br />* You like technology and neat solutions to complex problems<br />* You thrive on challenge and change; you naturally gravitate to the hardest questions first and love thinking differently to solve them.<br />* You are biased towards action and you’re happiest when you’re ‘getting stuff done’.<br />*You’re open, positive & straightforward. You’re not afraid to stand up for your convictions, even when it’s hard to do so.<br />* You delight in your colleagues’ successes and thrive on your failures; you grasp any opportunity for learning and constantly seek to improve.<br /><br /><br /><br />*Our* *mission*<br /><br />We believe that radical innovation in internet connected technology can ensure that every resident, every day, is living in a home that allows them to succeed. That’s why our products are built not just on great technology, but on an understanding of what people want from the space they live in.<br /><br />This approach led us to reimagine the most mundane household object, a thermostat, into a product that automagically reduces energy bills, looks great and offers control to those who want it.<br /><br />We are also revolutionising the way social landlords manage their housing stock with an obsessively tailored SAAS property dashboard and handy alerts on things like when the boiler is going to break.<br /><br />Our next project is to build the ultimate connected hub for the social home. It’s going to revolutionise the way residents interact with their properties and landlords manage their homes.<br /><br /><br />*Life* *at* *Switchee*<br /><br />We like to keep things simple and flexible at Switchee and consider you to be joining our family. We don’t currently track holidays so you’re free to take as much as you need. We often work remotely but are sensitive to the needs of our colleagues.<br /><br />We socialise together with regular outings in London and an annual “working remotely” trip where you have the option (but not obligation) to join us in working from a fun location.<br /><br />If we end up working together, we can offer a competitive salary and a generous stake in the company.<br /><br />If you believe in the same things, don’t hesitate any longer, apply now! Please be in touch soon as we’ll proceed once the right person is found. If you’d like to apply please submit a CV and cover letter on our website as soon as possible!"
