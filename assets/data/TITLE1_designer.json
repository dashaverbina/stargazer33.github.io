This is the last advert and INSPIRATIONAL, REAL and GREAT designers needs to see!<br /><br />We are seeking someone that can offer<br />Web design<br />ASP net and coding backend<br />HTML pages for our mailouts<br />and more things you can offer!<br /><br />[Who is writing this ENERGETIC email???]<br /><br />We are BoxSmart. A team of over 13 individuals that help small brands get better pricing for their packaging needs.<br /><br />We built Boxsmart to help talented people launch their brands and leave the filthy rat race that London has made these days. So you can get an idea of the type of people that run this ship – GIVERS.<br /><br /><br />This role is really to find the right PERSON. A ‘right person’ will work with the Martketing Director (nifty place to be if you influence them with your talents. Plenty of room in a startup to climb the ladder? Just a thought…).<br /><br />The ‘Right Person’ is a subjective thing but we know what it is. We can carve any intern to wherever they wish to go if you are like the ‘Right Person’ for BoxSmart. So here goes:<br /><br /><br />1- Someone that has a sense of PURPOSE. That doesn’t chase money (it comes as the byproduct of good work. We look after our family/team. We commit to everyone that works here are BoxSmart).<br /><br /><br />2- Someone that is simply fed up of the rat race. That is ‘boxed’ (excuse the pun) in a fixed role and can’t dip their finger in certain areas. Well we need someone flexible and up for trying new areas of the business – that way you can fall into a role you love later on within the team (see… we DO care)<br /><br /><br />3- A ‘giver’, not a taker: So many people take, take, take. Nobody gives first. Everyone at BoxSmart TRUSTS and gives first. Can you?<br /><br /><br />4- Someone highly creative. Lateral and charismatic. This is ESSENTIAL. We will know in the first TWO MINUTES on our phone chat – so you can’t hide!<br /><br /><br /><br />5- Someone that eventually wants to run their own business. I mean, why would a business not want to hire someone with those aspirations? Probably someone that wants you good enough to exploit but not good enough for you to leave right? Well at boxsmart we always offer other business ventures we build and aim for everyone to enjoy their lives by embracing GROWTH (we currently have three businesses we are building, alongside this. The right person is always welcome to take the reins. I mean, why not?? A good person deserves to grow).<br /><br /><br />6- Someone that has a LIFE TOO! This role is remote. You visit the CEO/Marketing once a week or so and work via phone. You have a life. Can pay your bills and work SMART. We don’t need someone imprisoned at a desk. We are over that. In fact we all work from home, coffee shops and have board meetings over dinners at nice restaurants! Why not? We are clever and we work in a remote generation.<br /><br /><br />The role:<br /><br /><br />This is the part where we tell you the core basics of the role:<br /><br /><br /><br />A – To support the Ceo/Marketing team in rebuiding the website and making the other sites to come<br /><br />B - To help with digital mediums for the BoxSmart departments: Exhibitions/PouchSmart and other spin offs that we are launching!<br /><br /><br />And that’s it! Just someone that wants to team up!<br /><br />[What do i get?]<br />Well we will pay you a 'case by case' amount, BUT we can also offer you commissions on any results we get online. We also will, once you hit 6 months, give you equity in any new website you build!<br /><br />So it's someone looking for the LONG BALL as well as a decent amount in the short term. We want a member of the TEAM<br /><br /><br />We will teach you all aspects of business. You are on the pulse with the CEO and the privilege to work with a a great team!<br /><br /><br />So it’s not just a job! It’s a JOURNEY!<br /><br /><br /><br />Have a think,.. We need the right person… the rest will fall into place.<br /><br />Team BoxSmart!"

A company you’ve maybe heard of before, or maybe not, but either way you’ve landed on this page because you were at least a little curious, and we like that about you. We spend our time making it easier for SMBs to talk with their customers. Today Help Scout is used by more than 8,000 businesses in 140 countries.</div><div><br></div><div>We’re looking for someone who’s really smart, and humble, and thorough, and meticulous, and self-motivated, and kind, and a little funny, and tenacious, and did I say self-motivated? Well, that’s because we’re a remote company! Being remote is fantastic, it’s empowering, and it’s perfect for people who like to be their own boss and push themselves to be at their very best every day.</div><div><br></div><div>That’s where you come in. As a Product Designer at Help Scout, you’ll spend your days creating tools that our customers use to deliver a great experience. Smiles on faces — if that’s your jam, we’d love to meet you.</div><div><h4>About the role:</h4></div><ul><li>You’ll be the sixth member of the Help Scout design team. We work remotely from places like New York, Sydney, Ireland and Nashville. You can work from wherever you please as long as you have 4+ hours of overlap with EDT (US East Coast).</li><li>We’ll ask you to own the entire design process. For a new project, you’ll be given a brief and will partner with Product to do User/Customer research. You’ll be doing the wireframes, prototyping, visual design, interaction design, and will partner with engineers to get the implementation juuuuuust right.</li><li>You’ll be embedded on a couple cross-functional teams with one product lead, one QA, and 2-5 engineers depending on the project. You’ll work hand-in-hand with your teammates to ship your best work to our customers.</li><li>Although each designer is embedded on different teams, it’s important that everyone makes each other better. Over Slack, video chats, and design docs, you’ll provide guidance and critical feedback on other work outside of your purview. You’ll also get that sort of support from your teammates on your projects.</li><li>You will have the freedom to pioneer your own discovery phase and find ways to improve our product. You’ll find that we’re passionate about putting in the work to constantly improve on the things we’ve made.</li><li>The role says “Senior” but we do not delineate between junior and senior designers on the team. We’re looking for senior-level skill and experience in every role at Help Scout, partially because it works better in a remote culture.</li></ul><div><h4>About you:</h4></div><ul><li>Your passion is to work on large-scale software a lot of people use, but to be given ownership of the project from concept to completion. The design challenges are complex, and the work has a bunch of constraints. Despite the difficulty, this is the work you love most.</li><li>We all love a good pattern library and pixel-perfect design, but you prefer to get involved in a project way before then. For you, it starts with sketches, wireframes and a keen understanding of the problem from all angles.</li><li>You’re very thorough and detail-oriented. You don’t get tired of solving a problem and iterating on the solution, even after a few months of working towards the best experience.</li><li>You’re humble, yet opinionated about what makes a great product experience. You leverage your skills and expertise to help others and make the people around you better at their craft.</li><li>You have more than a few years of design experience, and you’ve grown so much that you cringe when you look back at your early work.</li><li>You can simplify complex problems and clearly articulate your thought process to others in writing. This is especially important in a remote culture like ours.</li><li>You collaborate well and communicate early and often. You explain your work by extrapolating on everything from your inklings and curiosities, to the rationale behind final your decisions.</li><li>You actively seek critical feedback. As a matter of fact, you can’t get enough of it, because you know that your work only gets better when your team puts their eyes on it.</li><li>You have strong taste, and your eye for visual design is as strong as your ability to dream up exceptional customer experiences.</li><li>You prefer to collaborate directly with developers and product stakeholders, carefully considering the tension between business and customer needs.</li><li>When it comes to understanding a problem, you have no hesitation in setting up customer interviews, doing usability testing, or conducting a survey.</li><li>This isn’t an absolute requirement, but strong HTML and CSS skills will likely make you a more successful product designer at Help Scout. If you can write JavaScript, it’s all the better, but we won’t ask you to write production code.</li></ul><div><h4>Who you'll work with</h4></div><ul><li><a href='https://www.linkedin.com/in/lindaeliasen/' rel='nofollow'>Linda Eliasen</a>, Design Team Lead - You’ll be reporting to Linda.

They also are using BriteCore for several hours every day, and are concerned with doing things quickly and efficiently. This, along with the complicated nature of insurance, means we deal with some complex workflows, and try to set ourselves apart from our competitors with a smooth UX that helps them navigate these tough processes.</span></div><div><br></div><div><b><strong>What you might be doing</strong></b><br></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div><span>We’re looking for a team member who thinks critically about user experience, and is able to see it through with a polished interface.

And most of the people you will work with are scattered across the US and the globe. This means that remote team members are just as much part of the company as local employees. We also allow a lot of flexibility in terms of time off. In return, we expect all of our employees to be productive and accountable, which means you'll work alongside a great, dedicated team.</span><br></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><b><strong>Requirements &amp; Responsibilities</strong></b><br></div><div></div><ul><li>Several years of experience in the field is preferred<br></li><li>Ability to create effective and beautiful interfaces that solve our user's problems<br></li><li>Iterate and improve on existing parts of the app<br></li><li>Inform design decisions with data, user testing<br></li><li>Communicate clearly<br></li><li>Welcome feedback and collaboration<br></li><li>Be friendly, confident, and patient with others<br></li><li>Self-direct<br></li><li>Stay up on industry best practices and trends</li></ul><div><br></div><div><b><strong>Technology We Use</strong><br></b></div><ul></ul><div></div><ul><li>Sketch, Balsamiq, or other wireframing tools<br></li><li>Invision<br></li><li>Adobe Creative Suite</li></ul><div><br></div><div><span>Coding Experience is very helpful, but not required:</span><br></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><ul><li>HTML5<br></li><li>SCSS, PostCSS<br></li><li>GitHub<br></li><li>Command Line</li></ul><div><br></div><div><b><strong>Benefits and Compensation</strong><br></b></div><ul><li>$45k-$80k based on experience and proven performance<br></li><li>Benefit from working alongside and observing a team of world-class engineers and designers<br></li><li>Comprehensive health insurance coverage including medical, dental, and vision<br></li><li>Flexible schedule<br></li><li>Relaxed work environment<br></li><li>Remote work<br></li><li>Flexible learning time — explore your ideas and new technologies on the clock<br></li></ul>  </div>  <div>    <h4>Apply for this position</h4>    <p>See the full description and apply here:<a href='https://jobs.lever.co/britecore.com/85550062-7223-4ee3-b8d2-0188d5977d23' rel='nofollow'>https://jobs.lever.co/britecore.com/85550062-7223-4ee3-b8d2-0188d5977d23</a></p>  </div>"

You’ll have the chance to work on a personal performance analytics platform for gamers that is the first of its kind in a booming eSports industry that’s been growing exponentially for years.</p><p>This means the chance to improve the gaming experience of your fellow summoners all over the world, working alongside video game enthusiasts like yourself. The aim of our company is to build powerful tools that enable all players to step up their game and present their best self to the community they play in, AND of course, we want it to be a fun journey…</p><p>That’s where you come in! As a UX designer, we want you to design the interface that our players see and interact with every day. Players need to fall in love with our tool as soon as they start using it,  and your aesthetic sense is what will seduce them. In fact, they need to love using it so much that they reach a point they won't be able to live without it!  League of Legends is where we are starting, but if you love all sorts of games and find yourself thinking about tools you could create for them, you are definitely in the right place with us.</p><p>We have a highly transparent work philosophy for everything from workflow to salary. The team is distributed all over the world, so where you want to pitch up in a hammock in Thailand, work from your mother’s basement in Michigan or anything in between doesn’t matter. Your love for League and video games, your attention to detail, and love for user experience does.</p><p>Role-specific skills we’re looking for:</p><p>1. We want you to lead the design of the product and make sure that our app is beautiful and easy to use. <br>- We want you to think and design as an end user. To do that, you have to understand the nature of our users and be one of them. That means you should probably play a lot of games…competitively...</p><p>2. You should be familiar with the design process of a new app or feature. <br>- Be self-reliant enough to carry the whole team through the process. Start with user stories, sketches, and prototypes. Finish with the design of the interfaces and user testing.</p><p>3. You should be able to take broad concepts or ideas and turn them into valuable features for our users. <br>- Understand business needs and connect them with design decisions that can be articulated in individual or group settings. <br>- Partner with engineers, product managers, and data scientists to oversee the user experience of a product from concept to launch — and then continue to improve it.</p><p>4. Bonus points for:<br>- Experience in designing Dashboards for SaaS products.<br>- Experience in designing complex interfaces and making them easy to understand.<br>- Fostering a culture of design.</p><p>Life skills we value:</p><p>1. Plays the games with some measure of desire to improve. <br>- Of course, we want you to be someone who plays the games we create our tools around. Playing them may be enough, but to communicate to players effectively you must have some sort of latent desire to improve…No we don’t care if you are Bronze or Diamond.</p><p>2. Self-initiated, fast learner with a positive attitude. <br>- We don’t want to tell you what to do all the time. Hopefully, you will tell us what we need to be doing. <br>- We want “can do” people, not “can’t do” people. In our experience, passion breeds enthusiasm, which breeds a strong desire to learn. That’s why we want to know you care.</p><p>3. Strong sense of team spirit thriving in a fast-paced environment. <br>- Think of our team as a ranked team, we strive for excellence and don’t waste each other's time with BS. <br>- We all support each other, but that also means being good critics. Be able to take criticism! That is the only real path to improvement!</p><p>4. Excellent attention to detail, quality of work and time management. <br>- Be proud of your work, not for our sake, but for yours. We will be proud too! - Working hard is important, but being efficient is more important, so using your time wisely is paramount to successful projects.</p><p>If you love games and have a strong desire to create beautiful products for a passionate community of competitive gamers, this is the place for you. We really want to help players be their best self when playing with others around the world, and you should help us create that environment.</p></div>"

    "content": "Role: Designer, Heist Studios<br />Reporting to: Art Director<br />Location: Clerkenwell, London<br /><br />Our vision<br /><br />At Heist, we believe underwear can be an instrument of progress. While many industries understand our era’s desire for autonomy, choice and freedom, women’s underwear has lagged behind. Effectively, all women are living in underwear inadequate to their time.  <br /><br />We believe that radical innovation in underwear design can ensure that every woman, every day, is living in underwear that allows her to progress in the way that she demands in every other area of her life. That’s why our designs are built on an understanding of how bodies move, not just how they look.<br /><br />This approach led us to reimagine the most mundane wardrobe staple, a pair of tights, into a product that redefines superiority in comfort and fit for every female body. We’re now using polymer physics, computational engineering models and 3D knitwear to reinvent shapewear. Next, we’ll be taking our design ethos to make a bra that actually fits. (Finally!)<br /><br />Our journey<br /><br />We may be only two years old, but it’s already been quite a ride. Our first range reinvented the humble pair of tights, delivering 30% month-on-month growth and propelling us into the pages of almost every major European publication. We’re backed by some of the biggest investors in fashion and technology, and on a busy day, we can sell a pair of tights every 15 seconds. Even our tube adverts caused a scandal. Most importantly, we have tens of thousands of customers who genuinely love Heist and the products we develop and ship around the world. We are continually growing and creating a creative brand that not just looks good, but also tell a story.    <br />Your responsibilities<br /><br />As Designer, you will work on a range of tasks from designing emails and banners to advertising, across both print and digital. You will be working within our Creative team, supporting them on day to day tasks as we continue to grow.<br /><br />Being more specific, you will:<br /><br />•    Design work for new banner ads, print and web material.<br />•    Be able to constantly think of new designs to push Heist forward.<br />•    Ability to take ownership of design projects across multiple platforms both online and offline.<br />•    Provide final artwork across a wide range of projects, from print advertising through to display ads and social posts. This will include repurposing of existing assets.<br />•    Work with external partners and agencies<br />•    Support the creation of conceptual designs for new projects<br />•    Refresh existing email, print and advertising templates with relevant imagery and copy. <br /><br /> Your experience<br /><br />We firmly believe extraordinary people come from a wide range of backgrounds, but we would expect that you have:<br /><br />•    Advanced knowledge of studio software, including Adobe Creative Suite InDesign, Illustrator and Photoshop and skills in all other Creative Suite programs.<br />•    An outstanding awareness of current design trends.<br />•    A brilliant understanding of typography and layout and a good understanding of the print process.<br />•    Thorough understanding of asset supply requirements across all media disciplines<br />•    Past experience in retouching is a nice to have <br />•    The ability to work collaboratively within a team with other creatives and have the ability to take creative direction from the Art Director to bring design concepts to life when necessary.<br />•    Exceptional attention to detail<br />•    An excellent eye and passion for design.<br />•    The ability to meet deadlines without compromising quality<br />•    Creative agency experience is desirable <br /><br />You<br /><br />We are a diverse bunch of people at Heist. That said, there are some characteristics we always look for:<br />•    You deeply care about Heist’s mission; you have a desire to build something iconic, that will disrupt an industry, and women’s lives.<br />•    You thrive on challenge and change; you naturally gravitate to the hardest questions first and love thinking differently to solve them. <br />•    You are biased towards action and you’re happiest when you’re ‘getting stuff done’.<br />•    You’re open, positive & straightforward. You’re not afraid to stand up for your convictions, even when it’s hard to do so.<br />•    You delight in your colleagues’ successes and thrive on your failures; you grasp any opportunity for learning and constantly seek to improve."
