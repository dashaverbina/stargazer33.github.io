Sounds interesting? Read on.</p><p>ACT’s Core Infrastructure team is seeking fundraisers to help build the zero carbon footprint future version of our planet. Sounds interesting? Read on.</p><p>We believe that the core problem of global warming is lack of global collaboration. Our goal is to support and enhance global collaboration facilitated by an ecosystem of carefully crafted software systems. Just like Wikipedia is a computer facilitated collaboration platform around building the world’s biggest encyclopedia – so will ACT enable collaboration around green shopping and help humans ACT together for a sustainable planet so that we can do our part to end global warming and also support fair trade.</p><p>- ACT is software technology with smart gamification to connect consumers around sustainable shopping and collaboration.<br>- The immediate goal of ACT is to reduce climate gasses and possibly be the “solution” to global climate change.<br>- ACT is a role model of a democratic organization: Max factor of 8 between highest and lowest paid, all employees has 1 vote, no person or organization can own voting shares (i.e. no external organization can control ACT, which is important to keep us a partner of independent advice).<br>- All software is expected to be open source and free, so that all can take action.</p><p>We have just finished a major design phase and now wish to start serious development of the software platform. We are looking to tell the world about our extraordinary solution for ACTion, that we believe will change the way we manage global climate change almost overnight.</p><p>We need to strengthen our team, our advisory board and council with experienced resources within multiple fields: Management, Communication/journalism/marketing, Financial management, Fundraising, Life cycle analysis &amp; research, Graphical design, Web development, Mobile development, Backend development, Networking.</p><p>WHY ACT?<br>Have you ever thought that it is impossible to solve global climate change and that your effort would mean so little?</p><p>What if you had the chance to work with one of the most ambitious climate change projects? We believe that ACT is one of the most hands-on solutions to mitigating climate change. These might sound like just 'great words,' but do the math yourself: E.g. If only 1700 people decided to use ACT to find the least fossil fuel consuming goods, service alternatives and register their purchases it would deliver a combined purchasing power of 63 million USD/year after tax*, which is the same amount Norway uses to conserve the Amazonas rainforest! And those 1700 people could decide to ACT tomorrow!</p><p>* Assuming a salary of 37,000 USD/year after tax.</p><p>JOB DESCRIPTION, FUNDRAISERS / MARKETEERS<br>ACT is now selling shares and applying for funding with various organizations. We need 2 highly motivated FUNDRAISERS / MARKETEERS to join our Core team in this exciting phase that will have a serious impact on sustainability of our planet. </p><p>At best the following requirements apply to you:</p><p>- You have applied and won support from Innovasjon Norge on multiple occasions.<br>- You have applied and won support from various other foundations.<br>- You have experience from selling shares.<br>- You have a good network.<br>- You have a good command of English.</p><p>The fundraisers will work closely with co-founders and be a part of our small team of entrepreneurs with a flat organizational structure. Since the company is in an early phase you will be able to shape your role in the company exactly how you like it best.</p><p>WORK PLACE<br>This job should at best be carried out as much as possible in co-location with ACT in Oslo, but we are open to remote work too.</p><p>APPLICATION<br>Please send your CV and some words introducing yourself, why you want to work with ACT, highlight relevant previous experience and your current situation.</p><p>For more information about this job and ACT please contact:</p><p>Thomas Jepsen<br>President, Founder &amp; CTO<br>ACT Cooperative Corporation AS</p></div>"
