They are deeply frustrated by the volume of patients they meet with sight loss that could have been prevented if only it had been picked up earlier.</p><p>So, they have founded the company to address seriously unmet needs in the industry: home-monitoring and remote diagnosis.</p><p>They have some exciting partnerships already underway with Usborne, Bayer and Lego. They have been mentioned in the BBC and are in discussions with some exciting investors as a 'one to watch'.</p><p>You will be right hand to one of the Founders, taking over the technical side of the business working with an interim CTO who will be stepping away once you are settled into the role. You will be given full autonomy over the product to roadmap, design and create something for the future. With big growth expected by this young start-up you will be fast tracked into a Leadership/CTO position as we build out the development team.</p><p>What you will be doing: Building a game for Children which will allow practitioners, parents and careers to spot early signs of sight problems.<br>Skills: You will be a game developer, someone with a good solid background of IOS, Unity, Android and experience with C, C++,Java or C#.</p><ul><li>Experience building UI</li><li>Experience implementing <b>game logic</b>, and an understanding of game engine architecture</li></ul><p>The team are based out of Bristol and also have an office in Cardiff so you can work out of any location but you will need to travel between them both 3 days a week, you can work remotely twice a week. There will be opportunity for international travel to some of the best gaming events and conferences. The company are offering a very attractive package for equity which I can discuss over the phone.</p><p>Please call me to discuss this further on 0117 363 7402.</p></div></span>"

This is an opportunity to be part of something game changing!</p><p>I am helping a new start-up based in Bristol who have a vision to reduce blindness by making quality eye care available to everyone with a smartphone.</p><p>Founded by an NHS optometrist with a PhD in vision science and a Doctor with a background in app development. They are deeply frustrated by the volume of patients they meet with sight loss that could have been prevented if only it had been picked up earlier.</p><p>So, they have founded the company to address seriously unmet needs in the industry: home-monitoring and remote diagnosis.</p><p>They have some exciting partnerships already underway with Usborne, Bayer and Lego. They have been mentioned in the BBC and are in discussions with some exciting investors as a 'one to watch'.</p><p>You will be right hand to one of the Founders, taking over the technical side of the business working with an interim CTO who will be stepping away once you are settled into the role. You will be given full autonomy over the product to roadmap, design and create something for the future. With big growth expected by this young start-up you will be fast tracked into a Leadership/CTO position as we build out the development team.</p><p>What you will be doing: Building a game for Children which will allow practitioners, parents and careers to spot early signs of sight problems.<br>Skills: You will be a game developer, someone with a good solid background of IOS, Unity, Android and experience with C, C++,Java or C#.</p><ul><li>Experience building UI</li><li>Experience implementing <b>game logic</b>, and an understanding of game engine architecture</li></ul><p>The team are based out of Bristol and also have an office in Cardiff so you can work out of any location but you will need to travel between them both 3 days a week, you can work remotely twice a week. There will be opportunity for international travel to some of the best gaming events and conferences. The company are offering a very attractive package for equity which I can discuss over the phone.</p><p>Please call me to discuss this further on 0117 363 7402.</p></div></span>"

The experiences they publish work consistently across all browsers and devices, and all customer engagement is tracked with extensive analytics. All without writing code.</span></p><p><strong>About the Product</strong></p><p><span>Designing and building the Ceros platform is not an easy task. We require the best-of-the-best web developers, designers, and QA testers, ready to bring the functionality of desktop software to the web, often pushing web browsers to the limits of what’s currently possible.</span></p><p><span>Our codebase is 95% JavaScript and the Ceros product is comprised of multiple single-page applications with a client-heavy focus. We use libraries like jQuery, Require, and Backbone. The Ceros Studio is architected around the HTML5 Canvas element.</span></p><p><span>We’re not language zealots. We believe in using the right tool for the job, and our current server-side infrastructure runs PHP, Node.js, Redis, AWS Aurora, Chef, etc. on the Amazon AWS cloud.</span></p><p><strong>About the Team</strong></p><p><span>As part of the Ceros product team, you’ll be working with a small, cross-functional group of the most talented people you’ve ever worked with. We hire only passionate and creative people with a proven and unquestionable ability to execute, and every member of the team is equally responsible for moving the product forward.</span></p><p><span>We have a dynamic company culture that collaborates daily. We care deeply about the user experience, and we debate passionately about our ideas. When you work at Ceros, you check your ego at the door, and you aren’t afraid to be honest, especially to yourself. We take our jobs seriously but ourselves not so much -- whether it’s cracking jokes in the chat room or poking fun at the CEO’s atrocious spelling.</span></p><p><strong>About the Job</strong></p><p><span>Working completely from home, you’ll be communicating often through chat rooms, email, and video conferencing. We offer flexible working hours and an extremely flexible vacation policy. And we provide excellent gear (15” Macbook Pro, iPad, external monitor, etc.).</span></p><p><span>We believe that every piece of content created within Ceros is an experience. As such, we strive for the user’s experience to be as smooth as possible. To achieve this, we need developers with a passion for web performance. We’re looking for people with experience profiling javascript applications and squeezing every last millisecond out of the code. We want somebody that is knowledgeable in web performance best practices and strives to make code faster.</span></p><p><span>Desired experience:</span></p><ul><li><span>Object-oriented programming</span></li><li><span>Image &amp; video asset optimization (Webp, Adaptive bitrate streaming, etc.)</span></li><li><span>Asset preloading </span></li><li><span>Efficient use of caches</span></li><li><span>Building performant web animations</span></li><li><span>HTTP/2 protocol to streamline loading</span></li><li><span>Impress us with anything else you have experience with!</span></li></ul><p><span>As a developer, your typical day-to-day involves:</span></p><ul><li><span>writing maintainable code (probably goes without saying),</span></li><li><span>having your day ruined by functional QA testers who find every bug you write,</span></li><li><span>carrying out and being on the receiving end of intense code review sessions from your peers who hold your work (and their own) at the highest of standards,</span></li><li><span>agonizing over the user experience until even a trained monkey could use the product,</span></li><li><span>collaborating with and mentoring your peers on security best practices,</span></li><li><span>and finally, deploying your code to production and seeing the customer create something amazing and beautiful with it.</span></li></ul><p><strong>Next Steps</strong></p><p><span>If you’re interested in being part of the Ceros team, please send your resume and a cover letter to us.
