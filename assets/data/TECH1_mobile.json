Your creativity and intelligence are much more important to us than your experience with our stack.</p><p>How we work:<br>* Happy Customers &gt; Perfect Code. We're out to solve real problems for real people, not to write slick code or play with the hippest frameworks. We spend a lot of time thinking through how to build new features, but the goal is always for the implementation to be maintainable, not for it to be &quot;pure.&quot;<br>* Vision &gt; GroupThink. A big idea starts in one person's head. We make sure he or she has the space to develop it into a fully-articulated thought before we iterate on it as a group. No brainstorming, no design-by-committee -- these produce watered-down initiatives and incremental ideas.<br>* Writing &gt; Talking. Instead of sitting in meetings, we develop our ideas in writing, asynchronously. Written proposals encourage clearer thought and more thorough deliberation. Our plans are always documented and our culture is remote-friendly.</p><p>We're working on:<br>* Data capture. We want to provide our users with the richest possible dataset. That means building new integrations (like Android), capturing more semantic data (like A/B test groups), and pulling in data from other sources (like Stripe).<br>* Real-time infrastructure. We support an expressive set of queries that allow our users to slice and dice their data in arbitrary ways. The results need to come back with sub-second latencies and reflect up-to-the-minute data. We're working on a new distributed infrastructure to make this possible.<br>* Data visualization. Building Heap is as much a design problem as anything else. The most powerful analytics infrastructure in the world doesn't matter if our users can't access that power and understand the results.</p><p>We work in San Francisco but are absolutely open to remote engineers. We'd love to hear from you!</p><p>Interested? Apply here: <a href='https://heapanalytics.com/jobs#engineer' rel='nofollow'>https://heapanalytics.com/jobs#engineer</a></p></div>"

Simple, progressive and gameful, we bring to life all the sound traditional financial principles we were brought up with (or wish we were!) and make managing money smart, fun &amp; relevant for the modern world.</p><p>We believe the world would be a better place if we all talked about money a little earlier on in life. Research shows that our money habits are formed by the age of seven. That’s a pretty amazing opportunity to help give kids a head-start in building habits that will stick with them for life.</p><p><br></p> <p><strong>WHY ROOSTERMONEY?</strong></p><p>We're well-funded with significant traction; hundreds of thousands of families have downloaded the RoosterMoney app since our launch in January 2016 and we have over 51 currencies being used by children around the world. RoosterMoney has been featured in The Times, Telegraph, Guardian, Wall Street Journal, New Zealand Herald to name a few. We’ve been on CNBC and are considered experts in our field.</p><p>We are now expanding across a number of markets and looking for a talented and motivated senior UI developer to join our team to help us raise our game and achieve even more amazing things.

Aside from developing front-end applications, we expect you will also become involved with ops and back-end work with our Node API’s where required.</p><p>We are a small team so it’s important that the successful candidate isn’t just technically highly competent but is a good cultural fit. We run daily stand-ups, two week sprint cycles, retrospectives and utilise Slack for Chat and Jira for ticket and stream management.

Our multi-platform service, BrowZine, enables academic &amp; research libraries to make their peer-reviewed journals available to their patrons in an easy-to-use interface.&nbsp; <a href='http://thirdiron.com/customer-feedback/' rel='nofollow'>Response has been terrific</a>&nbsp;from a variety of&nbsp;professors and researchers at world-renowned institutions.</p><p><strong>Your Role</strong></p><p>As a Quality Assurance teammate, you&nbsp;will help&nbsp;ensure we ship high-quality software and minimize shipped&nbsp;defects&nbsp;for Third Iron's flagship product, BrowZine &lt;<a href='https://browzine.com' rel='nofollow'>browzine.com</a>&gt;, and its supporting services.</p><p>Your work will likely&nbsp;start with cleaning up our existing manual test procedures and creating new ones of your own. Since you are the first person who has a dedicated QA role, being&nbsp;creative about what to test is important to us, as well as being organized about how you will structure and otherwise write and maintain&nbsp;tests.&nbsp;Communicating frequently, abundantly, clearly, and empathetically are also core skills for this position.&nbsp;A good eye for things that look strange also helps!</p><p>Third Iron is a remote-first company. Everyone contributes remotely, whether software developer, customer support, or sales. We stay tightly in step with the needs of our customers - researchers and librarians - to help them browse, read, discover, and organize scholarly information.</p><p><strong>Key Responsibilities:</strong></p><ul><li>Writing test procedures</li><li>Managing test procedures and results&nbsp;alongside our JIRA issues for new features, bugs, etc.</li><li>Testing our software in an exploratory manner to find&nbsp;bugs that slip by the automated tests we write&nbsp;during development</li><li>Working together with the dev team to figure out what to test and to ensure you get test results to developers in a timely fashion</li></ul><p>You will be helping test&nbsp;multiple web apps, including&nbsp;<a href='https://browzine.com' rel='nofollow'>browzine.com</a>&nbsp;,&nbsp;and BrowZine's associated&nbsp;native&nbsp;iOS and Android apps.</p><p>Our software is written in a variety of technologies, but the ones you'll come into contact with the most are built using&nbsp;Javascript (usually NodeJS or Ember), Postgres, Swift&nbsp;/&nbsp;Objective-C, and Java.

Some of the testing will involve the UNIX command line, in addition to a variety of clicking in web browsers and tapping on Android and iOS devices.</p><p>Being a self-motivated tester&nbsp;who can work independently is important for remote work in general, and on our team.</p><p>A&nbsp;strong desire to learn new technologies is something our teammates share.&nbsp;We want to embrace the tools and techniques that help us build great software and let us sleep soundly at night, knowing our users are having a delightful experience and our servers are not catching fire.</p><p>When applying,&nbsp;please include anything that helps demonstrate your testing and quality assurance&nbsp;abilities, such as articles or blog posts you've written, bug reports on open source projects, or anything else you can share that is indicative of how you best contribute to a team.</p><p>We are currently taking applications from people with US work authorizations.</p><p>Please do not apply if you are a software development firm looking to hire out a team of your developers; we are interested in a single full-time candidate.</p><p><strong>About Third Iron</strong></p><p>Third Iron, founded in 2011 as a remote-first software development company, creates innovative library technologies to help academic libraries and the researchers they support.

We provide both the technology and services to enable our customers to not only take control of their data, but allow them to do amazing things with that control.</p><p>As part of that effort, we're changing the way that people do digital analytics by moving companies away from a one-size-fits-all mindset and enabling them to collect and own their data themselves.</p><p><strong>The Opportunity</strong></p><p>We’re looking for 2 open source Software Engineering Interns this Summer (May through August), for an 8-16 week paid internship, building on our previous successful Winter &amp; Summer internships.</p><p>Our interns work directly on and contribute to projects within the&nbsp;<a href='https://github.com/snowplow' rel='nofollow'>Snowplow open source stack</a>. We have lots of ideas for cool projects to do around Snowplow - and if you have any suggestions of your own, we would love to hear them!</p><p>This is a paid internship; we will consider remote candidates who are up to UTC +/- 5 hours maximum. Most of our engineering team works remotely so you certainly won’t be the only one!</p><p><strong>Does this sound like you?</strong></p><p>A Snowplow intern loves coding, enjoys experimenting with new technologies and is happiest working “in the open” on community/team projects. In terms of programming languages, we’ be particularly interested in hearing from you if you love Scala or have experience with big data frameworks.</p><p>However, our stack consists of Scala, Golang, JavaScript, Objective-C, C#, Java, Python - so, whatever languages you like working in, we can probably find something interesting for you to do. Technologies and tools we use at Snowplow include Spark, Kafka, Elasticsearch, Kinesis and Redshift.</p><p><strong>To apply</strong></p><p>If you’re interested, please send in your CV along with a summary about a piece of software you are proud to have written.<strong>Here are some do’s for your application:</strong></p><ul><li>Do tell us a little bit about yourself - what you are passionate about, what you are looking for in an internship</li><li>Do share any public profiles or contributions you have on open-source, libre or community projects</li><li>Do share links to publically available code written by you (perhaps something on GitHub or Bitbucket?)</li><li>Do suggest specific projects/initiatives/features that you would like to work on in your internship (it’s okay if you don’t know!)</li></ul><p><strong>Some don’ts:</strong></p><ul><li>Please don’t share any proprietary or commercial software with us</li><li>Please don’t attach any code to your application (but it’s okay to tell us about code that you&nbsp;<em>could</em>&nbsp;share later on)</li></ul><p>And that’s it!
