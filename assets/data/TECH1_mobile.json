Your creativity and intelligence are much more important to us than your experience with our stack.</p><p>How we work:<br>* Happy Customers &gt; Perfect Code. We're out to solve real problems for real people, not to write slick code or play with the hippest frameworks. We spend a lot of time thinking through how to build new features, but the goal is always for the implementation to be maintainable, not for it to be &quot;pure.&quot;<br>* Vision &gt; GroupThink. A big idea starts in one person's head. We make sure he or she has the space to develop it into a fully-articulated thought before we iterate on it as a group. No brainstorming, no design-by-committee -- these produce watered-down initiatives and incremental ideas.<br>* Writing &gt; Talking. Instead of sitting in meetings, we develop our ideas in writing, asynchronously. Written proposals encourage clearer thought and more thorough deliberation. Our plans are always documented and our culture is remote-friendly.</p><p>We're working on:<br>* Data capture. We want to provide our users with the richest possible dataset. That means building new integrations (like Android), capturing more semantic data (like A/B test groups), and pulling in data from other sources (like Stripe).<br>* Real-time infrastructure. We support an expressive set of queries that allow our users to slice and dice their data in arbitrary ways. The results need to come back with sub-second latencies and reflect up-to-the-minute data. We're working on a new distributed infrastructure to make this possible.<br>* Data visualization. Building Heap is as much a design problem as anything else. The most powerful analytics infrastructure in the world doesn't matter if our users can't access that power and understand the results.</p><p>We work in San Francisco but are absolutely open to remote engineers. We'd love to hear from you!</p><p>Interested? Apply here: <a href='https://heapanalytics.com/jobs#engineer' rel='nofollow'>https://heapanalytics.com/jobs#engineer</a></p></div>"

Simple, progressive and gameful, we bring to life all the sound traditional financial principles we were brought up with (or wish we were!) and make managing money smart, fun &amp; relevant for the modern world.</p><p>We believe the world would be a better place if we all talked about money a little earlier on in life. Research shows that our money habits are formed by the age of seven. That’s a pretty amazing opportunity to help give kids a head-start in building habits that will stick with them for life.</p><p><br></p> <p><strong>WHY ROOSTERMONEY?</strong></p><p>We're well-funded with significant traction; hundreds of thousands of families have downloaded the RoosterMoney app since our launch in January 2016 and we have over 51 currencies being used by children around the world. RoosterMoney has been featured in The Times, Telegraph, Guardian, Wall Street Journal, New Zealand Herald to name a few. We’ve been on CNBC and are considered experts in our field.</p><p>We are now expanding across a number of markets and looking for a talented and motivated senior UI developer to join our team to help us raise our game and achieve even more amazing things. We have a generous share option scheme as we believe that everyone within the company should share in the success they help build.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>THE ROLE:</strong></p><p>We're looking for a software developer who has held senior positions on front-end engineering teams, who will operate with a high level of autonomy, ensuring impeccable reliability. You care deeply about building applications with well thought out architecture.</p><p>You will be developing our core RoosterMoney app and working across the platform as a whole within our small but growing product team (currently 8), building an application that is used by families around the world. You have a passion for UX and UI, best practice development and building a product that delights users on a daily basis, taking pride in shipping quality code that is easy to test, maintain and build on. Aside from developing front-end applications, we expect you will also become involved with ops and back-end work with our Node API’s where required.</p><p>We are a small team so it’s important that the successful candidate isn’t just technically highly competent but is a good cultural fit. We run daily stand-ups, two week sprint cycles, retrospectives and utilise Slack for Chat and Jira for ticket and stream management. We use video calls to stay in contact and monthly all team meetings (State of the Rooster). We gather together every quarter for All Hands to celebrate successes, share ideas and plan for the next quarter of hustle.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Apply if you want to:</strong></p><ul> <li>Work closely with a small group of determined, like-minded people to reshape the way families talk and engage with money around the world.</li> <li>Play a critical role in the design and development of our app.</li> <li>Ship and take ownership of impactful new features and functionality.</li> <li>Develop robust deployment and testing processes </li> <li>Share your knowledge and passion with the rest of the team in making the app best in class.</li> </ul><br><p><strong>Benefits</strong></p><br><p><strong>In addition to a competitive salary:<br> </strong></p><ul> <li>Work with a fun, passionate team building something awesome.</li> <li>25 days holiday</li> <li>Pension Scheme</li> <li>Employee Option Scheme so you can benefit for all the input you put into the company.</li> <li>We will consider remote working for this role so long as you can spend up to 20% of your time in our London Bridge Hub office.

In addition, we are also open to opportunities for hiring developers from other cities around the globe to work remote on our devices.<br /><br />The project offers a series of challenges for being an iterative process, where we are always implementing and experimenting with features in a fast-paced environment. That promotes growth by giving you the responsibility to be always contributing with code that impacts directly the user experience.<br /><br />Technically, some of the main challenges involve dealing with multiple sources of media playback, managing and improving the many ways users can interact with these media (which are also conditioned by media types and app context, and maintaining and evolving the architecture, aiming to guarantee code that is well structured, solid and as accessible as possible for new developers, despite continually being changed by our iterative process."

Since you are the first person who has a dedicated QA role, being&nbsp;creative about what to test is important to us, as well as being organized about how you will structure and otherwise write and maintain&nbsp;tests.&nbsp;Communicating frequently, abundantly, clearly, and empathetically are also core skills for this position.&nbsp;A good eye for things that look strange also helps!</p><p>Third Iron is a remote-first company. Everyone contributes remotely, whether software developer, customer support, or sales. We stay tightly in step with the needs of our customers - researchers and librarians - to help them browse, read, discover, and organize scholarly information.</p><p><strong>Key Responsibilities:</strong></p><ul><li>Writing test procedures</li><li>Managing test procedures and results&nbsp;alongside our JIRA issues for new features, bugs, etc.</li><li>Testing our software in an exploratory manner to find&nbsp;bugs that slip by the automated tests we write&nbsp;during development</li><li>Working together with the dev team to figure out what to test and to ensure you get test results to developers in a timely fashion</li></ul><p>You will be helping test&nbsp;multiple web apps, including&nbsp;<a href='https://browzine.com' rel='nofollow'>browzine.com</a>&nbsp;,&nbsp;and BrowZine's associated&nbsp;native&nbsp;iOS and Android apps.</p><p>Our software is written in a variety of technologies, but the ones you'll come into contact with the most are built using&nbsp;Javascript (usually NodeJS or Ember), Postgres, Swift&nbsp;/&nbsp;Objective-C, and Java.

Some of the testing will involve the UNIX command line, in addition to a variety of clicking in web browsers and tapping on Android and iOS devices.</p><p>Being a self-motivated tester&nbsp;who can work independently is important for remote work in general, and on our team.</p><p>A&nbsp;strong desire to learn new technologies is something our teammates share.&nbsp;We want to embrace the tools and techniques that help us build great software and let us sleep soundly at night, knowing our users are having a delightful experience and our servers are not catching fire.</p><p>When applying,&nbsp;please include anything that helps demonstrate your testing and quality assurance&nbsp;abilities, such as articles or blog posts you've written, bug reports on open source projects, or anything else you can share that is indicative of how you best contribute to a team.</p><p>We are currently taking applications from people with US work authorizations.</p><p>Please do not apply if you are a software development firm looking to hire out a team of your developers; we are interested in a single full-time candidate.</p><p><strong>About Third Iron</strong></p><p>Third Iron, founded in 2011 as a remote-first software development company, creates innovative library technologies to help academic libraries and the researchers they support.
